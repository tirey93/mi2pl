`Rapp Scallion's Steamin' Weenie Hut...

`Steamin' Weenies!-- 20 ft.`
Ha!
Those guys wouldn't know a good story even if they paid fifty bucks for it.
When I find Big Whoop I'll become a legend among pirates for generations to come.
If I could only charter a ship and get off this stinking island...
He's back.
I told you, we don't have any marshmallows.
 Well, you guys can stop worrying about Largo...
 I ever tell you about the time I kicked LeChuck's butt?
 Tell me about this Largo guy.
 So why don't you kick Largo off the island?
 What's this about an embargo?
 How's the pirate biz?
 What's this about an embargo?
 Any idea where I could hire a ship?
 Do you guys know any piraty songs?
 Do you guys know any more piraty songs?
 Any marshmallows left?
 Well, I'll see you salty dogs later.
Look, Guybrush...
Besides the fact that we'd all rather die than hear that story again...
...there's another reason you shouldn't go spreading that story around.
He used to be LeChuck's right-hand man.
Largo LaGrande is back on Scabb.
You don't want to get Largo on your bad side.
A two-bit thug!
He's nothing but a low-down weasel!
Well, we would...
But he was very close to LeChuck...
But LeChuck's gone forever!
I heard they never found his body!
That's because I blew it into a thousand pieces!
Oh, no. Not this story again!
Horrible.
The sailing embargo has all of us pirates landlocked.
We can't go about our business.
Some of us tried pirating on land, but it just didn't feel right.
You'll need to go to the far side of the island...
And there you'll meet a man named...
...Captain Dread!
Yikes! Sounds intimidating.
Not really...
...once you get to know him.
Of course, he can't take you anywhere until Largo lifts his sailing embargo.
The Largo Embargo!
Well, it's not really an embargo.
It's a tax on ships coming or going...
But it's a HUGE tax that no captain on this island can afford.
Including Dread.
That fool Largo doesn't know when to stop.
He can't take more from us than we have!
Sure! Fink here knows a million!
Go ahead, Fink.
Sing that one about Scabb Island.
Oh, all right...
Well, I'd rather be a pirate on Scabb... Than a scab on a pirate.
And if you'll listen to me gab, I'll tell you why I admire it.
Oh, the people aren't too friendly. And the weather's not the best.
The lodging's too expensive, and Largo was quite a pest.
The lodging's too expensive, and Largo's quite a pest.
But the thing I like about Scabb is what it hasn't got:
No mayor or police force and no jail in which to rot.
That was beautiful.
OK, here's one about a pirate, his parrot, and a tragic day at sea...
You're not going to sing, `Polly the Squawker Lives in Davy Jones' locker,` are you?
You know that one always makes me cry.
Sorry, Bart.
Let me try one!
42!
508!
4!
OK, that's enough.
OK, that's enough.
Aw, I wasn't done.
Oh, I wish I could par-lay Some French with Governor Marley.
I'd say to her, `Voo-lay-voo?`
OK! That's enough!
No songs about Governor Marley.
Looks like Guybrush is still carrying a torch for the Governor.
Too bad he can't even talk to her in English!
Sorry, Mr. Sensitive.
The only other songs I know are dirty ones about Governor Marley.
Me too.
Marshmallows?
We don't have any marshmallows.
What's that white, puffy thing on the end of your stick?
It's the stuffing for under my eyepatch.
We're just sterilizing it.
We're pirates, Guybrush, not Girl Scouts.
He's history.
Oh really?
He must have finally got that nasty letter I wrote.
You sure can write a mean letter, Fink.
That reminds me, do we have any weenies left?
So I bust into the church and say, `Now you're in for it, you bilious bag of barnacle bait!`
...and then LeChuck cries, `Guybrush! Have mercy!`
`I can't take it anymore!`
I think I know how he must have felt.
Yeah, if I hear this story one more time, I'm gonna be crying myself.
Don't you have any NEW stories?
Well, actually, that's why I'm here on Scabb Island.
I'm on a whole new adventure.
Growing a mustache?
No.
Bigger than that.
A beard?!?
No, I'm in search of treasure.
The biggest treasure of them all.
A treasure so valuable and so well hidden, that it haunts the dreams of every pirate on the seas.
You mean...
Big Whoop?
                               Big Whoop?
None other.
Then, why'd you come here?
There's no treasure on Scabb Island!
Well, I didn't know that before!
Now I'm trying to charter a ship and look someplace else.
When I return, I'll have riches galore, and a whole new story.
Or you'll have died trying.
Either way, we won't have to hear about LeChuck anymore.

Now I don't get to do this.
Tough guy, huh?
Help!
Police!
Ha ha ha!
Scream as loud as you want!
There's no police on Scabb Island!
Then who keeps up the law and maintains order?
Then who eats the donuts and roughs-up the transients?

This is my lucky night!
Remember...

You can't ever hide
From Largo LaGrande!
Tough town.
I guess I should have got those traveler's checks.
This may be a lot of money, but it's nothing compared to how rich I'll be when I find Big Whoop.
I think I'm pretty well prepared, financially, for now.
I should be set for the whole trip with this.
This should be plenty of money to charter a ship.
Look at all this!
I've got enough to buy my own ship--in five different currencies.
I'll be traveling first class on this treasure hunt.
It sure took a long time to save all this.
No more part-time circus work for me.
Of course, this is only a fraction of what I'll have after I find Big Whoop.
Hmmm... Maybe I should get a money belt.
I wonder what I'll buy first...
Boy, this stuff's heavy.
I could just look at this money all day.
Money, money, money.
I'm confused by this strange urge to squander my wealth on immoral and dangerous vices.
I wish all those girls who wouldn't go out with me in school could see this!

I've got enough.
It's blank.
Nice monocle.
Thanks. I can't see a thing without it.
Did you pick up my love potion?
Oh yeah--love potion.
That's what I was supposed to get.
Hello.
Hi Wally.
Excuse me...
Oh yes. Hi there.
Can I help you?
Who's there?
I can't see anything without my monocle.
Oh, hello Mr. Brush.
Yes?
Did I mention that I'm Guybrush the LeChuck-busting stud?
My name's Guybrush. Who are you?
Hi. I'm Guybrush Threepwood, LeChuck-busting stud.
Hi. I'm Guybrush. Who are you?
Excuse me, do you know anything about Big Whoop?
Nice place you have here. Well, goodbye.
Uh-huh.
So I've heard.
Wally.
Wally B. Feed.
At your service.
Uh-oh. Who sent you here?
I should warn you: I'm heavily armed.
Nobody sent me. I'm free-lance.
I was sent by the I.R.S.  Let me see your files.
Don't shoot! I was just asking.
Well, well. Aren't we jumpy?
The who?
You'd better not try for my files.
All my research on Big Whoop is in there.
Well, that's a dangerous question.
I've been researching Big Whoop for years.
There are a lot of people who'd like to get their hands on my files.
You would be too if you were me.
Are you looking for Big Whoop, too?
Can I see your files?
Where do you think it's buried?
I'm looking for Big Whoop myself. Wanna help?
Well...
I haven't really been able to find out much hard information...
What do YOU know about it?
Actually, there's not anything in them.
I don't know if I'd be much help.
I know I'm looking for it, and that's about it.
I know it contains unimaginable wealth.
I know it's location is a mystery.
Um... I really don't know much about it at all.
You mean, you never heard of the four men who buried it?
No. Tell me all about it.
No, but I really don't care.
Oh, them? Yeah, I know about them. Of course.
Well, all anyone knows for sure is that there was a shipwreck.
The merchant vessel Elaine went down in a terrible storm.
Elaine?
Only four crew members survived.
They washed up on a remote, deserted island.
Some say it's name was `Inky Island,`
but I don't believe that.
Why don't you believe it?
Go on. Finish the story.
But what IS Big Whoop?
Because there's no such island.
Anyway, that's where they supposedly found Big Whoop.
But what IS Big Whoop?
Whatever it was, it was so wonderful...
...or so horrible...
...that they never wanted anyone else to find it.
So they took the map they made of the island...
...and split it up among the four of them.
And they all went their separate ways.
Wow. That's some story.
Where are they now?
You don't actually believe that story, do you?
I love that story. Well, bye!
Of course, it could just be an old legend.
But if I could just see the map of that island...
...I bet I could recognize the shape of the land and track it down myself.
Well, I don't even know their names.
You know, that reminds me...
I've got to get over to the Phatt City library and look that up...
...I'd go look them up at the Phatt City library...
...if it weren't for this stupid Largo Embargo!
Well, well.
Guess you don't need me, then.
Hey! I did it! Largo LaGrande left Scabb!
I have some more questions about Scabb Island.
I have some questions about Scabb Island.
Do you know anything about Big Whoop?
Could you tell me about the men who buried Big Whoop?
You know, I could just sit and talk about maps all day.
What exactly do you do here?
You know anything about this Largo guy?
How's business?
Is longitude the sideways one, or is that latitude?
Thanks.  I gotta go.
Would you mind if I just looked around?
No, no. Be my guest.
If you see my monocle, let me know.
That's great.
I guess I can stop with the bricks through his window now.
Hey! Me too.
Who couldn't?
What else is there to talk about?
Well, hey. That's my job.
Seems almost like we have.
Yep.
I can never remember which is which.
It's so cute when you laypeople try to understand geography.
I could try to explain it, but it would probably just go over your head.
I'm a cartographer.
You do open-heart surgery?
In here?
Uh... no.
I'm the mapmaking sort of cartographer.
Oh.
What kinds of maps do you make?
Is that all you do? Make maps?
Ha! Only sissies use maps.
Maps. Huh. That's interesting. Well, see ya.
...but unfortunately I don't have all day.
Well, I do some restoration work too.
I paste them together, re-copy them...
...paint little cupids in the corners...
...you know. Artsy-fartsy stuff.
Every kind a pirate could need!
My eyes have seen the whole world, and there's not a part of it I haven't put down on paper.
Maps are very, very important.
Not to me. I don't travel.
Actually, I prefer to just stop and ask directions.
You know anything about this Largo guy?
How's business?
I'm sure they are. Well, good-bye.
So you've told me.
That's even better!
With good maps, you can see the whole world without leaving your living room.
That's what Magellan thought.
Ha ha ha!
Sorry. Cartographer joke.
Why? Thinking about moving here?
Shoot.
Actually, I'm trying to get off it as soon as possible.
How can I get off this island as soon as possible?
You know anything about this Largo guy?
How's business?
Where's the Governor's Mansion?
I'm looking for some room and board.
Actually, I'd better not ask too many questions.
Thanks. That's all I need to know.
Thanks for the lowdown.
Anytime.
Maybe you should talk to Captain Dread.
Good luck!
With the sailing embargo Largo's imposed on Scabb, it's hard to get anywhere.
Which doesn't help my business, let me tell you.
Terrible!
No one needs any maps since no one can go anywhere thanks to Largo.
There is no Governor on Scabb!
This is an anarchist cooperative of pirates, cutthroats, and other criminals.
A haven for roughnecks and rebels like me.
The only authority on this island is that bully Largo.
Well, I hear there's a new chef down at the Bloody Lip.
And the Swamp Rot Inn has all the comforts of the sea.
But I think Largo's booked the whole thing.
Okay. But don't be shy if you think of a question.
He's just the local hood--shakes down everybody in town.
Nobody comes or goes from Scabb because Largo makes them pay through the nose.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Okeydokey.
Hey! Where's my monocle!
I can't see a thing without me monocle!
Dang! I've lost my monocle again!
What is that? I can't see a thing!
All I want is my monocle.
I'd rather keep it.
Oh, there it is. Thanks.
Ah, that'll work. Thanks.
No thanks. I already have a perfectly good monocle.
No thanks.
No thanks.
I have all the paper I need.
Pretty nice map, eh?
Of course it is.
I made it.
What's this? A map?
Hmmm...
Looks like only part of a map.
I can't make anything out of this.
It's incomplete.
Got any more of this?
I've got another piece right here!
Hmmm...
Still not enough.
I've got some more pieces right here!
Hmmm...
Almost, but a critical part is still missing.
I've got the rest of it right here.
Come back when you have the whole thing.
Maybe I can help you then.
Hmmm...
Very interesting...
Can you put it all together into one map for me?
I'll do it for you if you'll run an errand for me.
Go to the International House of Mojo and ask the fortune teller if my love potion's ready.
Okay.
I'll try to have this done for you when you come back.
Nice map.
Yep.
Uh-huh.
Thanks.
I like it too.
Drew it myself.
Not for sale, though.
Where'd he go?
Someone's hastily scratched a message here...
It just says, `LeChuck.`
Oh, no!
LeChuck's kidnapped the cartographer!
The poor little guy...
Hey! He has my map!
It just says, `LeChuck.`
Everything looks all blurry.
Yeah, me too.
Oh no.
Where is that thing?
I swear I put it right here.
I hope I didn't lose it.
I'll never be able to afford a new one.
How am I supposed to work?
Dang.
I'm such a dope.
Can't I do anything right?
Aw, shoot.
I bet my mom would help me find it...
...if she were alive.
For crying out loud.
I hope it didn't roll onto the floor...
Nobody move!
I can't believe somebody would STEAL it...
I'd go for help, but I'm afraid to walk around like this.
I'm stuck here forever!
I'm going to starve to death in here!
I'm going to die hungry, blind, and alone.
Why me?
I never hurt anyone.
Rats!
This stinks.
If I don't find it soon I'm going to lose all the monocle-grabbing muscles in my eye.
Here monocle. Here boy.
Crud.
What is he using to clean those glasses?!
I don't want to touch it.
It's too soggy to do anything with.
Yup, it's Largo's.
I don't want to do the bone dance here.
It's blank and kinda soggy.
Largo's been here.
I don't want to touch it.
It's too soggy to do anything with.
I don't want to touch it with my hands.
I don't want to touch it.
It's too soggy to do anything with.
I don't want to touch it.
It's too soggy to do anything with.
Eeeeu. Yuck.

Look at my beard!
Ha!

Tell you what--I'll let you have some near-grog.
It doesn't have any alcohol in it...
...but it's just as nasty-smelling and foul-tasting as that stuff grown-ups drink.
Right on!
Oh, wait. What am I saying?
I just sold the last of it to Kate.
Sorry.
Rats.
Of course, if you have some ID...
I'll need to see some ID for that.
Will you accept a temporary library card?
I must have left my ID in my other pants.
Who's this Kate person you mentioned?
In that case, I'll take my business elsewhere.
Aw, don't be sore, kid.
It's the law.
Let's just say I want to keep on the good side of it.
Why?
Sorry, kid.
You'll have to do better than that.
No ID, no service.
And let's just say I want to keep on the good side of it.
It's the law.
Why?
Let me see it.
Is Guybrush a French name?
No, actually it's a fictional name.
Oh.
Consultant?
You look more like a flooring inspector to me.
Free-lance?
Is that anything like a sanitary engineer?
No, not quite.
Well...
Unemployed??!
Didn't I give you a job?
Yeah, but you fired me.
Remember?
Oh yeah.
Uh... It's an old card.
Oh.
Pirate?!
We don't serve your type here.
Really?
No. Just jerking your leg.
Alright...
Can I get you that drink now?
Yeah, I could really use it.
Will you have more near-grog later?
Who's this Kate person you mentioned?
Maybe later. I gotta go now.
Dang.
Just when I thought I was going to do a little business!
Yeah, alright.
Ah, the Courageous Captain Kate Capsize...
Tough as steel, sharp as nails.
She rents her ship out...
...does some free-lance pirating.
Her only loyalty is to the highest bidder.
Don't get on her bad side.
Nope.
Next shipment is a month from now.
OK, but gimmie back your empties...
I'm running out of glasses.
Sure.
Now...
Name yer poison.
Whaddya got?
Well, we have some speciality drinks here at the Bloody Lip...
Like:
Yellow Beard's Baby, Bloody Stump, and Blue Whale.
Yellow Beard's Baby, Bloody Stump, and Blue Whale.
Yellow Beard's Baby, Bloody Stump, and Blue Whale.
 I'll have Yellow Beard's Baby.
Give me a Bloody Stump.
Mix me up a Blue Whale.
Come to think of it, I'm not that thirsty.
Don't have the stomach for it, eh?
Well, you can try, but I don't think nature's on your side.
Ha ha ha!
Just give me the drink, please.
Hey, I have to crack jokes.
It's a union thing.
Here you go.
I can't. Chain saw's out of gas!
Ha ha ha.
Ha ha ha. Hilarious.
Yeah. I crack myself up.
Here you go.
Sorry. Blender's not big enough!
Ah ha ha!
But seriously...
There she blows!
You haven't even finished the one you got.
Come on. Drink up.
Yep.
You lookin' fer work?
Just canned my cook.
Oh, yeah.
I really should take that thing down.
I hired a new cook just this morning.
But, if things don't work out with him, I'll let you know.
Sure is.
You want it?
Sorry.
That guy I hired is doing just fine, so far.
Depends.
Is there a good story behind it?
As a matter of fact, there is.
It's a story of the Ghost Pirate LeChuck and his gruesome demise--
Heard it.
This is the one where he drinks too much root beer and burps so hard he explodes, right?
Not exactly...
Frankly, I don't care much for stories that promote moderation in drinking.
I do have a business to run, you know.
Largo LaGrande has left Scabb Island for good!
Well, well...
I guess all those laxatives I was slipping into his drinks finally got to him.
What?!?
Don't worry. I don't put them in all the drinks.
Are you interested?
Actually, I had to fire my last cook, so I don't have any fresh stew.
We only serve gourmet chilled soups here.
Stew?
How gauche!
In fact, our new cook has been working all day on a very special vichyssoise.
Let me go see how he's doing.
How's the vichyssoise, Bernard?
Excellent, sir. Won't you have a taste?
I think I will...
OH MY GOD!!!
What kind of demented recipe book are you using?!?
Hee, hee, hee!
You're fired!
But sir!
Out!
Get out of my sight!
This is the most disgusting, filthy mess I've ever seen in my life!
Look at all the hair!
And what's this stuff?
How am I ever going to get rid of this junk?
Well, here's your soup.
Uh...
...I'm really not that hungry anymore.
Dang.
It's just terrible...
No one ever comes down here anymore.
Largo's got all my regulars spooked.
Because the law around here isn't the law at all.
It's Largo!
It's not so much Largo as it is who his boss was.
What do you mean?
I'd rather not say any more about it.
Please?
No.
Hey, can you cook?
A little.
How'd you like a career in the fast-paced world of pub-food cuisine?
Are you saying there's an opening in the kitchen?
Yeah. You interested?
Sure, I'll give it a shot.
No thanks. I like being my own boss.
I dunno. How much does it pay?
Can I have some time to think about it?
420 pieces of eight a week.
First week paid in advance.
Great! The job is yours.
Here's a week's worth of wages.
Now, go strap on an apron and get to work.
Okeydokey.
Well, come back and see me if you change your mind.
Sure, sure.
Take your time.
Oh good. You've come back.
Are you interested in the job now?
Excuse me...
Yeah, boy?
And here's a complimentary crazy straw.
We give them to all new customers of The Bloody Lip.
You're supposed to be cooking.
I took my break. It's the law.
The knives needed sharpening.
I went out for a swim.
I was out of milk.
I had to go to the bathroom.
Don't worry, I washed my hands.
Uh, I had to buy some eggs.
I had to go to the grocery store.
Nice try.
But not good enough.
You're fired.
Hey!
Don't bug the monkey!
Hey, what'd you do to my piano player?
Thanks.
I've been running low on mugs.
You keep it.
I hate rats.
He can't play piano in that state.
Keep him until he's better.
Leave my piano player alone.
There's not enough meat on it for a good stew.
I don't need that for anything.
Actually, I don't drink.
No thanks.
This drink's on me.
I don't charge my regulars.
That'll be one piece o' eight.
OK.
I don't have any money right now.
I'll let it go this time.
I don't have any money right now.
I'll spot you this time.
Go ahead and take my entertainment.
Thanks for nothing, buddy.
You know, I can mix any drink there is...
...make anything you could name...
...but I can't make the one thing that could really do this island some good.
What's that?
A voodoo doll of Largo LaGrande!
You there!
(Uh-oh.)
Give me my usual.
And put it in a real glass!
Fork over the dough, or you'll be serving Bloody Marys for a week.
From your nose.
That's all I have.
Well, you'd better have more tomorrow...
...or we might have to move this dump to a new location.
Like, say, the bottom of the ocean?
Ha ha ha.
Boy, you just gave him all your money?
I don't want to talk about it.
I think I should save this for later.
Maybe I can impress Elaine with how far I can spit.
I think I should save this for later.
I'd like to show Elaine how far I can loogie.
I don't like to mix my drinks like that.
That didn't do much.
I already have a drink like this.
I'll just put them together.
Boy...
This stuff makes my spit thick.
Well, take it outside, then.
No spittin' in here.
Yuck.
It's an acquired taste.
The barkeep would be mad if I left work early.
The barkeep might see me.
The barkeep might see me.
There's no glass in the window.
There's no glass in the window.
There's no glass in the window.

There's no glass in the window.
All I can see is water.
All I can see is water.
Yuck. It's all cans of fruit cocktail.
I hate fruit cocktail.
It's a cold potato and leek soup.
Yuck. A rat's been swimming in it.
Yuck. There's a rat swimming in it.
It's a cold potato and leek soup.
I've never been much for rodent seasonings.
It's too heavy.
Good thing this is a cold soup.
I don't know how good that would taste.
It's already closed.
The fire's out.
I'm no cook.
I'll bet it weighs half a ton.
I'll bet it weighs half a ton.
I'll bet it weighs half a ton.
I'm no cook.
He looks really into his cooking.
Sharp.
That doesn't seem to work.
That doesn't seem to work.
That doesn't seem to work.
I don't want to dull the blade.
I don't want to gunk up the blade.
My scoutmaster would kill me if he saw me use a knife like that.
Excuse me.
Don't bug me. I'm cooking.
I said, `Leave me alone!`
I'm trying to work.
I can't concentrate with you talking to me.
You're supposed to leave these things open.
I'd have to have a room first.
Busy guy.
Time is money.
Save your money. The inn's full.
Don't bug me. I'm busy.
Aw, isn't that cute.
I could lose a finger doing that!
I could lose a finger doing that!
I could lose a finger doing that!
I need that!
I have better things to do than beat up baby reptiles.
I think all he wants right now is sleep.
I could lose a finger doing that!
It's securely fastened.
It's tied to the post.
It's securely fastened.
It's securely fastened.
It's securely fastened.
It's securely fastened.
I love Cheese Squigglies.
Cheese Squigglies!
One of my favorites!
I don't need any more.
I don't need any more.
I don't want to steal his bell.
I feel bad enough setting his alligator free.
I don't think I'd get away with that.
I don't think I'd get away with that.
Be with you in a second.
Hmmm... only one guest.
Yeah, but that dang Largo eats like thirty.
Excuse me, I'd like a room please.
Sorry, we only have one and it's full.
Hold it right there!
That's a private room.
No going up there.
I told you, no going up there!
Hey!
How'd old Pegbiter get loose?
I'd better go catch him...
...before he catches somebody else.
Messy, messy, messy.
I'm not sleepy, and that bed is disgusting.
I don't have time for that now.
Largo could be back any minute!
It's a bit on the tattered side.
There's strange little white bugs all over it.
I don't think I should do that.
I don't think I should do that.
I don't like styrofoam.
It's bad for the environment.
I don't see anything special about it.
Then again, I never really have understood art.
They look pretty old.
I'd better not touch them...
It looks like somebody's trying to grow penicillin.
I'd better not touch them...

It's stuck open.
It's empty.
It's already open.
It's already open.
I should use the pins the voodoo lady gave me.
I think Largo's out of voodoo range by now.
It's little, mean-looking, and ugly.
Just like Largo.
I should use the pins the voodoo lady gave me.
I think Largo's out of voodoo range by now.

Maybe I'll just use these regulation voodoo pins that came with the doll instead.
Sharp.
I don't want to pin him.
I don't want to disturb them.
I don't want to pin her.
I don't think I should pin that.
He's short, but he's mean.
It's a bucket full of mud sitting on the door jamb.
Nice April-fresh scent!
I don't like to get naked in other men's rooms.
Nice door.
It doesn't seem to stay closed.
YOW!
Take that, you stumpy little dim-witted toad!
What?!?
Who do you think you are?
I'm Guybrush Threepwood.
People don't always recognize me...
That's why I carry this.
I'm gonna tear you limb from limb!
How are you DOING that?
Largo LaGrande, you are a no-good, vicious, two-bit thug.
I command you to give me back my money and leave this island!
Ha!  I already spent all your money!
Oh.
Well, I command you to leave this island!
Just you try and make--
YOUCH!!!
AIIIEEE!!!
AIIIEEE!!!
AIIIEEE!!!
That'll teach you to mess with the slayer of the Ghost Pirate LeChuck!
What's that?
YOU killed LeChuck?
As a matter of fact, I did.
Quite an interesting story, actually...
The fortune-teller said SHE did in LeChuck.
She did, did she?
Does SHE have one of THESE?
Is that...
Yes.  LeChuck's beard.
Still alive and wriggling.
Let me see that...
Boy, it IS alive!
We've been looking for a living piece of LeChuck for years!
Now we can bring him back to life!
Look out world!
The most fearsome pirate of all time will soon sail the seas again!
Whoops.
HEY!  What are you doing in here?!?
Get out of my room!
And stay out!
Stop bothering me!
You're a pain!
Why are you following me around?
Every time I turn around you're there.
I can't believe you're in here again.
Didn't I kick you out of here before?!
It's people like you who make people like me who we are.
You're invading my privacy.
A man's room is his castle.
Why can't you leave me alone?!?
I oughta beat you up for coming in here.
You have some nerve, barging in here.
How dare you come in here again.
Get out of my face!
Get out of here!
Get away from me!
Oops.
Yikes.
Sorry.
Bye.
I don't want to be that close to him.
I think I hear Largo coming.
Hey!  What the HELL?
What's going on?
Whoever did this is gonna pay!
I can't get this thing off my head.
When I get this thing off my head somebody's gonna be real sorry.
Maybe I shouldn't have done that.
He looked pretty steamed.
Who let you into my room?!!
I... uh... thought it was my room?
Well, it ain't.
So, get the $#*&# out of here!
HEY!
GET OUT!
GO AWAY!
Stop pestering me!
You again?!!
I was just leaving.
What are you doing in here again?!
Get out of my room!!
Scram, kid!
Leave me alone!
I thought I told you to get out!
It doesn't seem to stay closed.
It's a bucket full of mud.
It's just a bucket.
That doesn't seem to work.
I don't like mud in my drinks.
I don't want to drink from a bucket.
There isn't enough spit to put in the bucket.
I hate vichyssoise.
That won't do anything.
I don't think that will work.
It's sparkly clean.
No ticket, no laundry.
I've already cleaned that shirt.
It's not my size.
Young man, you should put that back where you dug it up.
Hey!  I don't launder money here!
Try investing in a casino.
What would I do with that?
He looks nice enough.
I've already cleaned that shirt.
It's not my size.

What would I do with that?
Nice April-fresh scent!
Not my size.
What are YOU looking at?
They're sleeping peacefully.
I think he wanted me to polish it FOR him.
I think they'd be mad at me for trapping their rat...
Somehow, I don't feel like they've earned it.
I doubt they'd be interested.
I did a pretty good job on it.
That wouldn't be wise.
There's not much left to polish.
That would be redundant.
It would take forever to hack through it with this knife.
No need for that now.
It's propped up by the twig.
It's closed.
It won't fit in my pocket.
One of my favorites!
The box is closed.
That wouldn't taste very good.
He looks too scared to eat.
I've played with that enough.
I think I'm too clumsy to hold the stick and tie a knot at the same time.
I think it's yo-yo string.
Cute little fella!
`No, we don't clean leather.`
`Not responsible for lost buttons or hooks.`
`Not responsible for stains left on clothing.`
I'll see what we have ready for Mr. LaGrande.
Ah...here it comes.
What do you know about Largo LaGrande?
Who are you?
I've got a laundry-type question.
I've got a laundry-type question.
I've got a laundry-type question.
I'd like to pick up some clothes.
Oops.  I thought I wanted to talk to you, but I don't.
I guess I'll be going now.
I made Largo leave this island.
Do I care?
You made cards out of sand?
I don't know anything about cargo or contraband!
I'm clean, clean, clean!
Sure, sonny, I can get out stew.
That's easy.
I can also extract grog, spit, and swamp-mud.
That's because I'm Maaaad Marty.
I'm mad about getting your clothes the cleanest they can be.
Shoot.
Would you be able to get out ketchup?
Do you do alterations here?
Actually, nothing.  I don't care about clean clothes.
Get out? Catch up?
What do you want me to do?
Uh... nothing.
Alter rations?
You mean, change the numbers on your food stamps?
You've got some nerve!
I'm sorry.
No, I don't have wheat loaves.
I didn't think you would.
Do you have your claim ticket, sonny?
Got it right here.
I'd like to keep my claim ticket for taxes.
It was stolen.
I must have left it in my other pants.
I dropped it in my grog and it melted.
Mom threw it out when she cleaned my room.
I lost it while being keelhauled.
NO, I DON'T HAVE MY CLAIM TICKET.
NO, I DON'T HAVE MY CLAIM TICKET.
You don't have to shout at me.
I can hear you.
But, I can't give you your clothes without a claim ticket.
Taking it bowlin' was a dumb thing to do.
Why'd you trade it for chocolate-covered ants?
The log welted it?
Well, now that is a good excuse.
But I can't give you your clothes without a claim ticket.
What?? You beaned your mom with a broom?
You should treat her better than that.
Your dog got mauled?
What does that have to do with a claim ticket?
Oh, never mind.
What?  Your wife has fake lashes?
She got your claim ticket, or something?
No.  Forget it.
Great.
You're making me mad, Marty.
That's my name--don't wear it out.
Look.  I want it free...and I want it tonight.
Party tonight?  Sure, I'll come.
I'm talking about getting my laundry.
Don't worry about me.  I've been dry for three years.
I said, `I need it back tonight.`
What?  Yeah, we'll stay out all night.
This is useless.
You tell him I'll be back to pick it up... or else.
I know it's here somewhere.
I saw it a while ago.
Now where was it?
I think I'd better make myself scarce instead.
Not now!
Can't you see there's an emergency happening here?
Hey...
Hey, guys...
Yo...
Yoo hoo...
Ahem.
Excuse me.
Yoo hoo.
WAKE UP!
What is it?
Hi.
Long time no see.
Remember me?  I'm Guybrush.
Did you ever get that circus started?
Do we know you?
I'm Guybrush Threepwood, a mighty pirate.
I'm Guybrush, the man who rid the world of LeChuck.
I'm Guybrush.  You tried to sell me the minutes of a PTA meeting in the last game, claiming it was a map.
I'm Guybrush, and I was just leaving.
How nice for you.
Sure, you are.
Map?
Err...
I don't know what you're talking about.
Fine.
No, really--
Why did you wake us up, Gorbush?
What is it this time, Graybrash?
What is it this time, Gooblush?
What is it this time, Flybrunch?
What is it this time, Frygoosh?
What are you guys doing up there?
How come you have to perform on that ledge?
What happened to your leg?
Say, I've got some time to get that polish now.
Is that your rat?
See you later.
We're performing.
That's right.
Performing.
In our current work we portray man's response to global environmental issues of a changing world.
It happened during a performance.
When he lost the leg, Frank was brilliantly showing the inseparability of the path man walks...
...from the food chain.
The symbolism of the cheese was essential.
Yes.
We call him `Muenster Monster,` because of his insatiable passion for cheese.
We can scarcely contain our anticipation.
Ah...
...to show the precarious nature of the situation.
...so to speak.
Right, right.
Oh, I see.
I think you're overlooking the potential symbolism to be gained by your closeness to the earth.
Sounds like a crock of monkey snot to me.
You do?
Oh, good.
Err...
But...
Great.
Here's some money for the polish.
All right, you got us.
We're really up here because...
...well...
We're afraid to come down.
What?
What's the word for it, Frank?
Err...
Ahh...
Hmm...
Dirtaphobia?
Groundaphobia?
Terrafirmaphobia?
Stupidity?
It's the opposite of acrophobia.
Something like `orcaphobia.`
Fear of killer whales?
Fear of strange vegetables?
Sounds more like `workaphobia` to me.
Say what you will, we're not coming down.
You know, this leg is looking sort of dingy.
Would you get some polish over at the woodsmith's and polish it for me?
Sure.
Give me money for the polish.
Actually, I'm kind of busy right now.
Thanks.
Here's some money for the polish.
OK.
OK.
That's what we do for a living now.
You see, after our circus failed, we started a pirate catering business on nearby Phatt Island.
`The Sacking Lunch.`
It was quite lucrative.
Why aren't you still doing that?
What does this have to do with `performing?`
Then what happened?
I'm getting to that.
The governor of the island made us an offer we, er...
...couldn't refuse.
So we sold him the business.
Yeah?
What did you do with the money?
But what does this have to do with `performing?`
We're getting to that.
We sank the money into one of those new-fangled glass-bottomed boats.
We wanted to take passengers on sight-seeing trips...
...and search for a place called Drinky Island in our spare time.
Boy, did we ever want to get there!
Aside from the obvious reason, we had inside information that Drinky was in fact the resting place of the legendary treasure of...
Big Whoop!
Big Whoop?  I'm looking for that, too!
Big Whoop?  Er, did you find anything?
I don't see what this has to do with `performing.`
Well, I hope your luck is better than ours.
Not exactly.
We're getting to that.
You see, we got a bit of a raw deal on the boat.
Seems the salesman didn't have any glass for the bottom...
...so he just left a gaping hole there.
By the time we noticed, we were taking on water fast!
We ended up stranded on a tiny desert island.
When do we get to the performing part?
How much longer is this story?
I think it's past my bedtime.
We met a philosopher on the island, and he told us something which changed our lives.
That you're a pack of loonies?
That you should bore passers-by to tears with long stories?
What?!  What is it?!  What did he say?!  Tell me already!
He told us that all the world is a stage and that we are merely players.
So, we became performance artists.
Hey, leave that alone.
Sorry, is this your bucket?
Do you think you could let me have this bucket?
OK.
OK.
OK.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Please?
Pretty please?
Pretty pretty please?
Pretty please with sugar on top?
Pretty please with sugar and a cherry?
Pretty please with sugar, nuts, and a cherry?
Pretty please with sugar, nuts, a cherry, and chocolate sprinkles?
I really need it.
I really really need it.
I really desperately need it.
It's a matter of life and death.
If you don't give it to me I'll never speak to you again.
I'll be your best friend.
I'll be your best friend forever and ever.
Aw, come on, be a pal.
I didn't want that old bucket anyway.
Oh...
...all right.
Well...
...no.
So, you won't mind if I take it?
I guess not.
Thanks!
Here's a piece of eight for your trouble.
I'd give you a piece of eight, but I'm fresh out.
Aaaiiieee!!!
My leg!
Help!
Someone get a doctor!
Muenster Monster!
'--squeak--
Go get help!
I'd better beat it in case those guys wake up!
Hey!
SHUT UP!
It says, `Woody.`
Good practice, but I think I need some wood.
Just bring the hammer back when you're done with it.
I don't think I should hammer that.
I don't think I should hammer that.
Nothing like a pocket full of nails to keep you on your toes.
Help yourself to as many as you'd like.
Good practice, but I think I need some wood.
I don't think I should nail that.
I don't think I should nail that.
I may be a lazy guy, but carrying around my own place to sit is too much.

I don't have time to sit.
He looks buff.
I don't think he'd like that.
I don't think he'd like that.
Hey, nice stick.
Thanks.  Don't need it.
No, thanks.
I've got my own.
You keep them.
I've got plenty.
No, thanks.
Got plenty of my own.
Sorry, I don't give refunds.
I can't do anything with that slimy thing.
No, thanks.
I don't think he'd like that.
It says `Out on house call.`
`Please come again.`
I don't want it.
I don't want it.
I don't feel like it.
I don't feel like it.
I don't feel like it.
I can't.  He's lacquered it onto the wall.
It's too heavy to move.
It's too heavy to move.
It's too heavy to move.
I'm not a carpenter.
No thanks.  I don't touch other people's stools.
No thanks.  I don't touch other people's stools.
No thanks.  I don't touch other people's stools.
I don't have time to sit.
If only I could use this stuff on my lines...
I don't want to polish that.
I can't reach it.
I can't reach it.
I can't reach it.
It's too high.
It's too high.
It's too high.
It's too high.
It's too high.
It's too high.
It's too high.
It's too high.
It's too high.
It's too high.
It's too high.
It's too high.
Excuse me... could you take a look at this?
Hmmm... looks like a valuable antique.
Be careful with it.
Looks fine to me.
Hmmm... looks like a massive fracture.
If you're gonna be using this, I'd better reinforce it for ya.
Here ya go, Boy.
Steel shank...
Alloy splints...
Better than new.
It says, `Woody.`
That's me.
Pounds and pounds of nails.
Comfortable looking chair.
Nice catch!
Oh boy, it's Buzzsaw Girl!
Nice, sturdy workbench.
What a cute little stool.
That's about the best peg leg I've ever seen.
Thanks, I made it myself.
Nice peg leg.
Thanks, I made it myself.
Nice craftsmanship.
I made it myself.
Hey!  Don't touch those!
Hey!  Don't touch that!
Get away from there!
Oh, no you don't!
Get your hands away from there!
What do you think you're doing?
It's not a toy.
I need all of them.
It's not for sale.
I fought hard for that baby.
No one touches her but me.
Everything's laid out just how I need it.
It's adjusted to my height.
Ahem...
Yeah?
What's the problem with that Largo guy?
Nice apron.  Are you some sort of chef?
How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
Could I buy some wood polish?
I'd just like to browse, thanks.
I'd like to look around a bit.
Sure thing.
That's one piece of eight.
Anything else?
Largo LaGrande will never bother you again!
Yeah, I heard Marty stuck a bunch of pins in his underwear or something...
...drove him right out of town.
No, it was me!
You?
What were you doing with Largo's underwear?
Ummm, well...
Oh, never mind.
He really goes against my grain!
I'd like to make an end table out of him...
but I don't have the guts.
With all my tools, I'm still unable to create the one thing that could do this island some good.
Like, an all-night tattoo parlor?
No, like a voodoo doll of Largo LaGrande!
Oh.
No, I'm a woodsmith.
Which gives one of us an excuse for dressing funny.
A woodchuck could chuck no amount of wood since a woodchuck can't chuck wood.
But if a woodchuck could chuck and would chuck some amount of wood, what amount of wood would a woodchuck chuck?
Oh.  Shut up.
Even if a woodchuck could chuck wood,  and even if a woodchuck would chuck wood,  should a woodchuck chuck wood?
A woodchuck should chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood, as long as a woodchuck would chuck wood.
Oh.  Shut up.
Oh.  Shut up.
Hey, you started it.
OK, but don't touch anything.
Thanks for returning that.
Funny.
That looks just like my hammer...
... which I have been missing.
Could you just put it back on the hook for me?
Just put it back on the hook and I won't press charges.

Oooh, looks like human ashes.
I don't think I need anymore.
I think I've taken all I should from this grave.
Why should I bother with this guy's ash?
Well, OK.
There's something in it.
It's a piece to the map of Big Whoop!
It's only a fourth of a map--not too useful.
`Steamin' Weenies!`
I don't think it'll work there.
It's a piece to the map of Big Whoop!
It's not mine to use.
I'd better not.
What are you bugging me for?
This is easy mode!
Whew!
That was a close one!
If I didn't have my flame-resistant apron on, I would've been killed!
Well?
You WERE killed, Rapp.
Uh... Where exactly did you buy that apron, Rapp?
Yep.  Close one, alright.  Say, about that Big Whoop deal...
Yeah, well, be more careful next time.  See ya.
Stan's Previously-Owned Restauraunt Supply...
Why do you ask?
Look, Rapp...
Big Whoop?
Ha ha ha!
I'll take that secret with me to my grave!
Oh, you have it with you?  Great!
I got some bad news for you, Rapp...
I guess I'm out of luck, then.  Well, bye.
What are you talking about?
Well, Rapp, it's like this...
...You're dead.
What?!?
You're deader than dirt.
Your life is well done.
You've shivered your last timber.
You're the prep-cook at the pearly gates.
You're two weeks past the expiration date.
I'm...
...dead?
Cold as leftover pork chops.
Stiff as a frozen foot-long.
Green as year-old pickle relish.
Crusty as a stale bun.
Sealed up and covered with goo like a canned ham.
But, I'm not ready to die!
I feel my soul is not at peace.
There is something I must do before I pass on.
Like, you mean, finish War and Peace?
Perfect plumps-when-cooked weiner technology?
Produce an heir to the Steamin' Weenie fortune?
Pass along your part of the map to Big Whoop?
No.
I just have this nagging feeling I left the gas on in my restaurant.
It's driving me crazy.
Did I mention I'm looking for Big Whoop?
I'll check the gas for you, Rapp.
Did I mention you're dead?
Sorry.  Didn't mean to bother you. Rest in peace.
Give me the map and I'll check the gas.
You were right.  The gas was on.
Sorry to bother you.  Rest in peace.
Did you turn it off?
Uh...
...no.  Was I supposed to?
Oh, will there ever be relief for my tortured soul?
I turned it off.
Thanks.
You can have my part of the map to Big Whoop--
'--but only if you do me a favor first.
Could you check the gas in my weenie hut for me?
What do you care about it?  You're dead!
Sure, I'll check it.
You were right.  The gas was on.
Give me the map and I'll check the gas for you.
Sorry.  I've got better things to do.
Pleeeeease?
Check the gas and I'll throw you the whip.
I mean, give you the map.
Check the gas and I'll give you the map.
Oh yeah?
Well... me too.
Thanks.  Here's the key.
I guess where I'm going I won't need this map anyway.
Thanks.
Now I can rest in the folds of the earth...
...like a Steamin' Weenie in a soft, fresh bun.
Ahhh...
Silty.
Maybe I should just let him rest in peace now.
In the small crate of voodoo supplies that would be his home for the next five days and nights, Guybrush is forced to eat bat lungs and eel bladders to stay alive.
Eventually, Guybrush and the rest of the slithering cargo are delivered to the very doorstep of the Caribbean's most fearsome villain, living or dead:  The Ghost Pirate LeChuck!
Ah...
LeChuck's crate of voodoo supplies.
You know, we usually don't deliver out this far...
You guys bucking for a tip?
Well, we figured since...
Well you figured wrong.
LeChuck don't tip nobody!
Gee...
...what a butt.
Ick.
I hate snakes.
Creepy, but apparently seaworthy.
I don't want to pull it out of the water.
It might be covered with jellyfish and swampy parasites.
I'd better get in it first.

Well, let's get it on the truck.
I don't want any more mud.
Wow.  A whole bucket o' mud...

OK, `brother`, watch out, 'cause I've got my OWN doll, now!

Guybrush Threepwood.
It's been a long time since you last came to see me.
Back again, Mr. Threepwood?
Wally sent me to pick up some love potion.
I got a book of voodoo recipes for you.
I really could use that re-vitalizing creme.
Hey, I've got some ashes for that potion.
About that jar I was looking at...
Do I know you from somewhere?
What kind of ingredients do you need for the doll?
About that voodoo doll...
Why don't you just put a curse on Largo?
Tell me about this Largo guy.
How's business?
I'd like to have my fortune read.
Just wanted to say hi.  Well, see ya.
Well, that's enough voodoo for me.  Bye.
It'll be much better once you use that voodoo doll on Largo!
Yeah, it worked pretty well, didn't it?
I still have the touch.
Sorry, no returns on personalized voodoo products.
If it's not working I suggest you get closer to your subject.
Oh, OK.
Tell him I said to enjoy, but to be careful.
It's powerful stuff.
Wouldn't want that little guy getting hurt--
Wait!
I just felt a sudden disturbance in the Force...
As if a tiny, tiny voice just called out in fear...
...and then hastily scratched a message in a table.
I think Wally's in trouble, and I think LeChuck has something to do with it!
Uh-oh.
I'd better go check.
Ah, we often forget those who help us most.
We do?
It was I who told you how to do away with LeChuck.
I told you where to find the voodoo antiroot...
...and how to turn it into the powerful ghost-dissolving potion you needed.
Oh, yeah.  Now I remember.
Very good.  Many hexes this week.
Saved many people from the evil eye.
Made many pieces of eight, although Largo took most of them.
He's a weak little man who bullies this whole island around.
Most people are afraid of him because he was once LeChuck's right-hand man.
But LeChuck's history.  I got rid of him myself.
True evil can never be destroyed completely.
You will see.
I see a hard road for you, Guybrush.
Things didn't get easy for you when you defeated LeChuck, did they?
People only wanted more.
You had to keep proving yourself over and over.
The pressure kept mounting until you lost it all--
Your fame... your fortune...
...the one you love.
OK, that's enough.
I've tried.
My most powerful magic lies in voodoo dolls.
But to make an effective doll I need some items from Largo's person, and no one's brave enough to go get them for me.
Are you willing to help me make one?
Uh, maybe.
To make it work you need to bring me some personal artifacts of the victim.
One from each of the four basic voodoo groups:
Something of the Thread...
...something of the Head...
...something of the Body...
...and something of the Dead.
Hey, that almost rhymes.
For the Thread, I need a piece of Largo's clothing.
And a lock of hair will do for the Head.
Bring me a sample of fluid from his Body,
And from his Dead relatives you must acquire some remnant of a corpse.
Here--take this shopping list.
Thanks.
Do you have any of those ingredients with you?
I've got the real stuff back here.
That's one of my most powerful potions.
But I only give it out in cases of serious need.
That's one of my most powerful potions.
Brings the dead back to life.
Yes?
I'll take it!
I could do lots of cool stuff with that!
That doesn't sound quite proper.
I was just looking at it.  Can I go now?
There are some complications.
It only works on ashes, and the resurrection is only temporary.
Plus, you need to bring me a sample of the subject's ashes before I can mix you up a batch.
I have the ashes of somebody I'd like resurrected right here.
Boy, voodoo's complicated.
Rules are rules.
I can't make you any of that potion without some ash from the subject's remains.
Bring them to me.
Now, there's only one small problem...
I forgot the recipe.
What?!
It's been a long time.
I don't have that cookbook anymore.
I've got a book of voodoo recipes!
Good!
How many crab scalps does it say to use?
Thirteen!
Good.
That's just what I thought when I whipped up this experimental batch.
Thanks.
Remember, just a dab'll do ya.
I told you, I don't have that cookbook anymore.
What a drag.
Hey, I got a license!
So be it.
Now, go!
I've given you all the help I can, for now.
The rest is up to you.
Have you brought me the ingredients?
Have you brought me the final ingredient?
Have you brought me any more ingredients?
I have his toupee.
I have some of his spit.
I have the bone of his Grandfather.
I have this pearly-white bra.
I have this clean, white shirt
I'll bring them later.
I'll bring it later.
I'll bring you more later.
Hmmm...  Not quite a part of his head...
But maybe I can get some scalp fragments from it.
Excellent.
Perfect.
Yes, that will work.
Good.
You may keep the paper.
Do you have the final ingredient?
Have you brought me any other ingredients?
At last!
Now I can make a voodoo doll to be reckoned with!
Let me get my juju bag.
And now for the ingredients...
A dandruff flake from Largo's head!
A single piece of Largo's thread!
A drop of fluid from his body!
A single chip off the bone of the dead!
And finally, some miscellaneous voodoo herbs and seasonings, including monosodium glutamate.
This ought to be good.
Two!  Four!  Six!  Eight!
Who do we assassinate?
Largo!  Largo!  Yeah!
Hey!  That looks just like him!
Thanks, Voodoo Lady.
One more thing...
Some of the ingredients were not the optimum specimens.
It should still work, but it will have a limited range.
You will have to get close to Largo.
Very close.
Nope.  What was that last one?
Nope.  Could you tell me what they were again?
Just like the list says...
Something from his body...
Something from his clothes...
Some of his bodily fluids...
Something from his ancestors...
...that's all we need to complete the doll.
...that's all.
I'm afraid it's true, Guybrush.
If they have any animated tissue, they can reanimate his whole body.
But I blew his body into a zillion gooey pieces!
Not his body, Guybrush.
You destroyed his spirit form.
His body was safely buried far away.
But by now it must be...
Rotten?
Partially decomposed?
Yes.
And I don't think that's going to make him any more pleasant to deal with.
He's going to be looking for me!
Yes.
He's going to try to kill me!!!
Undoubtedly.
What can I do?
Where can I hide?
Can you give me something to protect me?
Can you just kill me now and get it over with?
You're already doing all that you can.
What's that?
There is no place to hide.
But there is a way out.
What is it?
You're doing it right now.
Fiddling with the change in my pocket?
He has magic just as strong as mine.
Nothing I could give you would protect you.
You must try not to lose hope, Guybrush.
There is a way out.
Hunting for Big Whoop.
Oh yeah, I was doing that, wasn't I?
Big Whoop isn't just a treasure.
It contains the secret to another world.
Find that world and you'll be able to escape LeChuck forever.
But I know so little about Big Whoop...
Take this book.
`Big Whoop: Unclaimed Bonanza or Myth?`
Where'd you get this?
I checked it out at the Phatt City Library.
I foresaw your need.
Gee, thanks.
I used your name when I checked it out, so be sure and return it when you're through reading.
The overdue fines in Phatt City are pretty steep.
Gee...
...thanks.
Guybrush, you don't have any time to waste!
I can offer you no more help.
Your destiny is in your own hands now.
Hey!  That's just a display model!
No thanks, I don't need it.
I don't have any warts.
I don't have a cat.
After all, it is only a display model.
...and I feel bad for the skinks.
Voodoo's not known for its good smells.
I don't even want to know what it's used for.
I don't like heavy syrup.
...and I feel bad for the spiders.
I don't have that problem anymore.
I don't have an eyepatch or any missing limbs.
I don't think Dread's map will help me navigate this swamp.
I don't think Dread's map will help me navigate this swamp.
I'd better ask about chartering a ship before I hand over my money.
Would you like my monocle?
Would you like my money?
Would you like this?
No thanks, mon.
I've already got one of those.
Thanks, mon!
I was look'n for another lucky sailing necklace.
Thanks, mon!
This will do just fine for my lucky sailing necklace.
What was that, mon?
No thanks, mon.
What con I do for ya?
Are you Captain Dread?
Ya mon, I'm Captain Dread.
What can I do for ya?
Hello?!?
Hello mon.
My name's Captain Dread.
What can I do for ya?
It's me again.
So I see.  What can I do for ya this time, mon?
I need to charter a ship.
Why can't I charter your ship?
I need to charter a ship.
Natty dreads.
Gee, I think I've met your friend.
Tell me more about that necklace thingy you lost.
I gotta run, lots of treasure hunt'n to do.
Like I said before, mon...
You're in luck, my friend.
Rumor has it that Largo's been run off the island...
...so I'm now free to sail again.
I can't charter you my ship because...
Besides...
Only problem is...
...that you don't look like the type that has 20 pieces of eight.
Actually, I do have that much.
Well, mon!
Consider my ship chartered!
Great!
Where's your ship?
You're standing in it, mon.
Yikes!
Yeah, you're right...
...I'm broke.
Unlikely.
Thanks, mon.
It happened sometime ago.
My navigator and I set sail for this legendary island.
When we arrived, we were taken prisoner by cannibals.
I escaped, mon, but my navigator was not so lucky.
All I found of him was one of his eyeballs, and I've kept it as a good luck charm.
OK, bye, mon.
Come again.
Mon, I gotta take you back to Scabb Island.
I got goods I gotta deliver.
Welcome to the Jolly Rasta!
Where do you want to go?
I don't know, what are my choices?
I'll show you on the map you gave me.
Please take me to Booty Island.
Please take me to Phatt Island.
Please take me to Scabb Island.
I'd just like to cruise aimlessly for a while.
I'd like to go back to the island I just left.
You know, I used to go out with Governor Marley.
What happened to the map I gave you?
We'll never find the island without it.
I'll go back and get it.
OK, just let me know when you want to get someplace.
I only know how to get to three islands, mon.
What are they?
There's where we just came from, Scabb Island.
The only island where pirates are free to be pirates.
Then there's Booty Island.
The festive, French, Mardi Gras, party-all-the-time, island.
It's run by one of the most respected and loved governors around...
...Governor Elaine Marley.
Elaine?
And last, there is Phatt Island.
A fascist dictatorship, run by an over-bloated pig named Governor Phatt.
Here, take this easy-to-read reference map, courtesy of Dread Tours.
You can use it to show me where you want to go.
Sure you did, mon.
I lost my lucky `eye that has seen the world` sailing necklace.
No way, mon.
...a while ago, I lost my lucky sailing necklace.
I called it 'my eye that has seen the world'.
I can't sail without it.
...Largo has an embargo on the island.
...That mean and nasty guy, Largo...
...he has an embargo on the island.
No ships can sail in or out without his approval.
There's no way he'd let me leave.
I love a house with that nautical look.
It says, and I quote:
`Captain Dread's Ship Charters`
`20 Pieces of Eight`
`Inquire within`
It's only one-quarter of a map--not too useful.
Well, I got half the map now...
...but I still can't figure it out.
Just one more piece to go!
Hmmm...
I think I need an expert to figure this out.
It has a picture of a parrot on the front.
It's empty.
It's empty.
I'm off to find Big Whoop.
Finally...
Alright!  I got the first map piece!
Yeah!  Now I've got two map sections!
That makes three map pieces--only one to go!
That's the last map piece.
Gee... I still can't make heads or tails of it.
I think I need an expert.
I can't reach it.
I can't reach it.
Excuse me, sir.
Yes?
Aren't you Guybrush Threepwood?
That's right.  I'm the man who swashed the Ghost Pirate LeChuck's buckles.
Who wants to know?
No, my name is Smith.  You must have me confused with someone else.
I'm really in a hurry.
I'm sure that's a very interesting story, but we don't have time for that now.
Smith, eh?
That's an unusual name.
Hold on, sir.
Perhaps you have some identification?
Err... I must have left it in my other pants.
Why yes, I-- GOOD HEAVENS!!  My wallet's been stolen!
Look behind you, a three-headed monkey!
My ID is on my ship.  Wait here while I go and get it.
That's the second lamest excuse I've ever heard.
Of course it has, sir.
Nice try, Guybrush.
I'm with the local constabulary, sir.
You'd better come with me, Governor Phatt would like a word with you.
All right, I'll come with you.
Am I under arrest?
I'm really very busy.  Could we do this another time?
If you want to put it that way, sir, yes.
Oh.
All right, let's go.
Coming!
Well, Mr.--
'--oh, excuse me.
Well, Mr. Threepwood, I can't tell you how pleased I am to have you here as my guest.
Oh, why is that?
I can't say as I care much for your method of invitation.
Thank you.  Your home is lovely.
Would you like to hear the story of the time I blew LeChuck's top?
Look, I'm really in quite a rush...
I thought we might talk about a few things.
I simply wanted to insure that you didn't slip away before we had a chance to meet.
There's something I'd like to discuss.
You have an eye for the finer things, Mr. Threepwood.
Ha ha ha
Funny you should mention LeChuck, as he's the reason I brought you here.
You wanted to thank me for getting rid of him, eh?
Well, no thanks are necessary.
You see, I--
Oh, do stay a while.
We have much to discuss.
Such as how much it must cost to keep you in finery?
Such as how much it must cost to keep you in food?
Such as why there's a wanted poster on the wharf with my picture on it?
Such as why there's a ten-foot guard blocking the door?
Want to hear about me destroying the evil LeChuck?
Be careful upon whose toes you tread, Mr. Threepwood.
Such as your future, Mr. Threepwood.
And that of the Ghost Pirate LeChuck.
`Destroying,` is it?
At least I can SEE your toes.
I'm sorry.  I just meant that you seem to live so WELL...
Why, you--
'--excuse me.
Let's get down to why you're here, shall we?
I intend to SELL you.
To the Ghost Pirate LeChuck.
Ah, I see.
I admit my tastes run to the expensive.
To the exPANsive is more like it.
How do you manage to afford it?
I am not a patient man, Mr. Threepwood.
Yes, I've had to indulge in a bit of creative financing.
But I've just made a deal that will keep the bill collectors out of here for a long time.
Selling your old clothes to make circus tents?
Melting down your silverware to build an oil pipeline?
Renting yourself out to ship captains as ballast?
Selling advertising space on your stomach?
Oh really?  What's that?
I'll be selling something which I believe I shall be GLAD to be rid of.
I'm selling YOU, Mr. Threepwood.
To the Ghost Pirate LeChuck.
LeChuck's dead.
I killed him.
Perhaps you didn't kill him quite so thoroughly as you imagine.
He looked perfectly healthy the last time I saw him.
Last time you saw him?!?
Oh, no!
LeChuck's back!
I beg your pardon, did you say something?
I took care of LeChuck once, I can do it again.
He doesn't scare me.  Just tell me where I can find him.
Could I hide out here for a while?
You'll get your chance.
I rather think he'll find YOU, Mr. Threepwood.
You can hide out until LeChuck comes to pick you up.
You see, he's put a sizeable bounty on your head.
Oh?
A bounty I intend to collect.
Oh.
Whatever bounty LeChuck's offering, I'll double it.
I guess that bounty would buy a lot of bacon grease and pure fat, huh?
Ha ha ha
Very amusing, Mr. Threepwood.
Why, you!
You can figure it out while you wait in jail for LeChuck to pick you up.
Take him away!
Yes, sir, Governor Phatt.
Come on, you little weasel.
I'll be back!
I'll be BACK!
I'LL be back!
I'll BE back!
Come on!
Don't try to escape or anything.
Walt will chew you to bits.
OK, Walt, I'll be back to relieve you at eleven.
Excuse me.
Yes?
Aren't you Guybrush Threepwood?
No, my name is Kate Capsize.
You must have me confused with someone else.
Kate, eh?
That's an unusual name.
Perhaps you have some identification?
My ID is on my ship.  Wait here while I go and get it.
Nice try, Guybrush.
I don't know how you got out of the jail, but I'm taking you back in.
It's Captain Kate.
It's stuck to the wall.
I wouldn't want to implicate an innocent bird.

Armed and dangerous?
Right on!
I don't think so.
Looks only slightly better than he smells.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I doubt he'd appreciate that.
I doubt he'd appreciate that.
I doubt he'd appreciate that.
Hey, don't touch that!
It's precisely balanced for maximum hydrophonic fibrilation.

I said, hands off my fishing rod.
Hey, don't touch that!
It's precisely balanced for maximum hydrophonic fibrilation.
I said, hands off my fishing rod.
It IS a nice pole.
Caught anything yet?
Yeah, but nothing gross enough to make you eat yet.
(Heh heh heh)
Oh, hi.
Given any more thought to that little wager?
Are you kidding?
I reached my limit hours ago!
More than I could ever eat!
I'm Guybrush Threepwood, a mighty fisherman.
I'm a game warden.  I'll have to confiscate your pole.
Well, I gotta go.  Good luck.
Oh, you are, are you?
I'm the best fisherman in these isles!
I'm also the man who caught the notorious LeChuck!
Yeah!
Oh, I beg to differ with you:
I'M the best fisherman in these isles.
Yeah, RIGHT.
If you fish as poorly as you lie, you don't even deserve to be talking to me.
I'm the best fisherman in these isles, you know.
Oh, yeah?
You?  Why, you couldn't fish your way out of a paper bag.
You?  Why, you couldn't catch cold in a blizzard.
You?  Why, you couldn't catch a fish at a restaurant.
Not!
What?
What's THAT supposed to mean?
The pike I catch make Pike's Peak look like an anthill.
That's why I'm known as `The Blowfish.`
You mean `The BlowHARD.`
I'M known as `The Sturgeon Surgeon.`
The fish you catch are so small you'd need tweezers to throw them back.
Oh, yeah?
...
Listen bait-for-brains, I'm the best around and that's that.
Not if your hooks are as dull as your wit.
Not if your bait is as tiny as your brain.
Not if your line is as weak as your lines.
Not if your reel is as rusty as your imagination.
Not if your lures are as ugly as you are.
Perhaps you'd like to make a small WAGER, eh, Mr. Fisherman?
You're a game warden, eh?
Let's see a badge or something.
I must have left my badge in my other pants.
I don't have to show you any stinking badge.
Actually I'm Guybrush Threepwood, a mighty fisherman.
Look behind you, a three-headed fish!
I think I'd better be going.
Hah!
I think so, too.
I think you're just trying to get your hands on my fishing pole.
Do you fish?
Of course.  Why else would I want your pole?
I'm the best fisherman in these isles.
No, actually I've never been fishing in my life.
Why do you want to know?
Well, I was just thinking about a small WAGER.
Are you a betting man?
Sure, I'll take your bet.
No, I'm not a gambler.
What sort of wager were you thinking of?
Let me tell you what I had in mind first.
Pity.
It would have been...
...interesting.
If you can catch a bigger fish than I can...
...I'll GIVE you my prize-winning fishing pole.
Sounds fair.
What's the catch?
Kiss your pole goodbye.
But I don't even have a hook!
Improvise.  I'm sure you'll think of something.
If I catch a bigger fish than YOU...
...you have to eat it.
RAW.
Raw?
RAW?!?
You mean, on rice with a little wasabi and soy sauce?
Ick.
Where'd you get that other pipe?
No.
Exactly.
ahem
What?
Like I say, you'd have to eat a raw fish.
Plain, cold, and with the head still on it.
What do you say?
All right, it's a bet.
It's a revolting idea.  I can't think of anything I'd less rather do.
I need more time to think about it.
OK.
Let me know if you change your mind about being a wimp.
OK.
I'll be right here.
Great!
I am really looking forward to making you eat my catch.
What with all the sewage from Governor Phatt's mansion, the fish are usually pretty gross.
I never eat mine, just sell them to restaurants.
Best get fishing, buddy.
Heh heh heh.
Catch ya later.
<chuckle>
Nice pole.
Thanks.
Err...
Think I'll drop a line right here.
Plunk.
Wow, I've got a nibble already!
Holy cow, he's a monster!
I've got him!
What a battle!
Wow!
This is the biggest--
'--er--
It's almost as big as the leviathan I just hauled in.
Really?
Where IS this `leviathan?`
Errr...
I think you're lying.
Yeah, you're right, it was just a fish story.
I guess you win.
Here, take the pole.
Say, thanks.
I've been looking for a copy of this book to help me identify some of the stranger looking fish I've caught.
Can't you see I'm busy?
A fine example of dieting gone horribly wrong.
He's not exactly my type.
No, thanks.
No, thanks.
Hey, who's your tailor?
No, thanks.
The door is locked.
That doesn't seem to work.
I hope I don't have to sleep here.
It's already pulled back.
It's already pulled back.
It's already pulled back.
That doesn't seem to work.
I don't want to.
It's a tibia.
I can't reach it.
It's a stick.
This one's too big.
What a ferocious-looking dog.
I wouldn't want to make it angry.
I wouldn't want to make it angry.
I wouldn't want to make it angry.
Hello, little doggie.
The door is already open.
It's a plastic recycleable bottle of near-grog.
I'll only drink part of it.
OK.
Mr. Guybrush Threepwood
Arrested for infractions too numerous to list.
It's empty.
It's a stick.
It's a tibia.
This reminds me of a story about a farm girl and...
...oh, never mind.
I don't want it to get all brown and mushy.
OK.
Mr. Willy Gorilla
Arrested for grinding his organ in public.
It's empty.
What a big organ!
I don't know how to play.
OK.
Guybrush Threepwood
Arrested for infractions too numerous to list.
Claims she was framed.
It's empty.
The door is locked.
Here doggie, doggie.
Here boy...
Watch me flip it right into my pocket!
They don't call me the Bone Master for nothing.
I better keep this, I might want to give it to someone later.
Idiots!
Fools!
Who is this Peepwind character, anyway?
They can't keep me locked up!
I'll figure a way out of here!
Hey!
Uh, oh!
I can explain, I--
Thanks for letting me out of there!
You'll have to excuse me if I don't stick around.
I've got to find out who FRAMED me!
Hey!  That tickles.
There's a banana in here...
And an organ.
Hey, there's some near-grog in here!
Uh-oh, it's stuck.
I think I broke it.
It's not open.
This looks like a lighthouse on a beach.
It doesn't open.
It's already open.
There's a model lighthouse lens inside.
Looks like a normal ladder to me.
Everything looks all blurry.
Looks powerful.
She looks kind of surly.
I wouldn't want to.
She's not my type.
Bad idea.
Bad idea.
They look closed to me.
There are so many books here...
I'll never be able to find anything.
What, every single one?
I don't want to carry that many books with me.
I don't think that would be a good idea.
I don't think that would be a good idea.
I can't read that fast.
Excuse me...
Hi, I'm looking for a book.
Want to hear a fantastic ghost story?
SHHHH!!!!
This is a library!
WHISPER!
Now, what is it?
Pardon me, Miss.
What do you want this time?
I'm looking for a book.
Why do you have a model lighthouse here?
Sorry.  I didn't mean to bother you.
Then why did you?
There's a new lighthouse being built in town.
That is a scale model of what it will look like.
It's very attractive, for a lighthouse.
Does it work?
Why do you need a lighthouse?
Yes, and it will be very bright, too.
It will have one of the most powerful magnifying lenses in the Caribbean.
I'd show you with the model, but unfortunately the bulb has burned out.
It wouldn't be much of a lighthouse if it didn't, now would it?
Actually, I meant the model.
Oh!
Yes, normally the model works, too.
The bulb is burned out right now, but there's a scaled-down lens inside.
We're tired of rebuilding the wharf every time a boat goes through it.
That's why it has to be very bright.
It will have one of the most powerful magnifying lenses in the Caribbean.
Do you have a library card?
No.
No, how do I get one?
I must have left it in my other pants.
Well, would you like one?
Yes, what do I have to do?
No, thank you.
Then stop wasting my time.
But you DO have one?
Well... no.
Certainly.
I'll have to issue you a temporary card.
I said you could only check out four books at a time.
You'll have to give some back before you can check out any more.

I don't know, what have you got?
I won't be needing any more books just now.
Whoops, I've just remembered an appointment.
You already have four books checked out.
You'll have to give some back.
You've already checked that book out, Mr. Threepwood.
You've already checked that book out, Captain Dread.
You've already checked that book out, Mr. Toothrot.
That book has been checked out by Governor Phatt.
OK, here you go.
That's your limit.
You'll have to give some books back before you can check out any more.
Anything else?
Don't slam the door on your way out.
Remember, books are the treasure of the mind.
Remember, silence is golden.
Please put the lens back in the lighthouse.

You may check books out of the library, but only four at a time.
That's about as many titles as I can remember anyhow.

Captain Marley!
(Wonder if there's any relation?)
They buried their treasure along with plenty of--
'-- uh, oh--
'--booby traps on a place believed to be called Inky Island.
It says here there were four pirates:
Rapp Scallion (the cook)...
...Young Lindy (the cabin boy)...
...Mister Rogers (the first mate)...
...and Captain Marley.
They buried their treasure along with plenty of booby traps on a place believed to be called Inky Island.
They made a map which they divided into four pieces, each man taking one.
Rapp Scallion later opened the Steamin' Weenie Hut on Scabb Island.
It was a huge success but fell into disrepair after Rapp was killed in a flash fire.
Young Lindy drifted aimlessly, down on his luck until he mysteriously came into money while panhandling on Booty Island.
He used the cash to bankroll an advertising firm which failed after its gross mishandling of the Gangrene 'n' Honey account.
Mister Rogers retired off the coast of Phatt Island.
He marketed homemade contest grog brewed in a bathtub until his recent disappearance.
Captain Marley vanished while sailing in the America's Cup race.
His boat was leading at the time.

But I don't recognize you.
What!  You don't remember me?
No, I was transferred here today.  New orders.
No...
But that's OK.
You wouldn't have gotten the password right if you weren't a member.
What?
Umm...  Sorry...

I'm not a mason.
He certainly does like his rum.
They all say `RUM`.
I can't hold my alcohol.
They look like normal barrels o' rum.
I can't hold my alcohol.
They look like normal crates o' rum.
I can't hold my alcohol.
They're half empty.
I can't hold my alcohol.
They're half empty.
I can't hold my alcohol.
They're half empty.
I can't hold my alcohol.
They're half empty.
I can't hold my alcohol.
They're half empty.
I can't hold my alcohol.
It's empty.
It looks just like my mug of grog.
I think I'll leave it here for Rum Rogers.
I don't want to sit right now.
Back again, eh?
Let's get this over with.
Yes?  What do you want?
I was wondering if I could come in for a minute.
I'm selling these fine leather jackets.
I'm conducting a survey.  May I ask you a few questions?
Is the lady of the house home?
I'm looking for a map.
Oops.  Wrong place.
What do you REALLY want?
I'm looking for a map.
I heard about this guy who used to live here...
I'd like to find out some information from you.
Sorry to bother you.  I'll go now.
I knew it.
Look, kid:
I'm sick of you would-be treasure hunters comin' over here.
I just inherited this house two months ago.
And every single day, all I've heard is `**rap tap tap**  Do you have a treasure here?`
Why can't you people just go away and leave a retired pirate in peace?
All I want to do is come in for a minute.
Please.
Pretty please.
I won't touch anything.
I'm Guybrush Threepwood.  Prepare to die.
No.
I said `NO!`
Leave me alone.
I'm tired of being hassled.
So... you want to sword fight, do you?
Sword fighting is for wimps, weenies, and sissies.
Giving up so easily?
Wow, this game's a cinch.
I have a better way to solve a dispute.
Real pirates solve their differences with a drinking contest.
Drinking contest?!
Come on in.
I'll get us set up.
This is my special grog.
It's just for contests.
Twice the alcohol, twice the calories.
I can't believe you're back for more.
Most people just give up and go away.
In fact, I'd really like it if you went away.
Don't you know when enough is enough?
You know you're not going to beat me.
I'm the best at this contest.
I wish I'd never bought this house.
It's only caused me trouble.
All these treasure hunters wanting to come in.
Excuse the boxes.
I haven't had time to put them all away.
Especially with all the people trying to get into my house.
I hate having to waste it.
Well, I guess you're serious about this contest.
OK, let's get on with it.
But I guess you want to go through with this.
Here's your drink...
I'll only use part of it.
All gone.
Are you sure you don't want to back out?
No, thanks.
I can hold my own.
No, thanks.
I'll be fine.
No, thanks.
I'm a pro.
You drink first.
Just what I expected.
Typical.
Novice.
He's too young to drink anyway.
Oh, you already drank yours.
Boy!  You're good at this contest.
That was fast.
You must be thirsty.
Take mine.  I'll go get more.
Now it's your turn.
Oh.  Your grog's a funny color.
It might have spoiled.
From what I'm told,
Nobody can drink the special contest grog without feeling faint.
There's a special drink that I like.
You ever tried booze from the West?
I used to like this drink when I was younger...
I found this great drink from a foreign land.
On the ship, we had a drink that we couldn't live without.
My usual drink used to be a strange drink made by cannibals.
But I've been practicing.
It's a bit on the bitter side.
Makes your lips pucker.
It's rather sweet.
It's smooth as a pirate's savvy.
It's sharper than a forked tongue.
Tastes just like chicken.
You know, most of the treasure hunters just leave when I ask them to.
But it's powerful medicine.
But it's weaker than a sponge soaked in water.
But it hurts as it goes down.
But it slides down the throat like fire.
But it's stronger than a mule team.
But it's got a wonderful aroma.
But you.
You're persistent.
I guzzled it with the best of them.
Never could get enough of that stuff.
Used to drink it all the time.
I had cases and cases of it
All in one day.
Used to drink barrels and barrels of it.
My buddies and I drank it faster than we could open the bottles.
It'll get you places in life, boy.
I could give it up anytime I wanted.
Then I came to my senses.
Then there was a shortage of it a few years ago.
Then my supply ran out...
And my girlfriend went with it.
Then the taxes on it were raised.
Then I realized that I relied on it to get up in the morning.
But it won't get you into my house.
But I needed something else,
so I drank rum.
So I started drinking rum to fill the gap in my life.
That's why I started drinking rum.
That was when I took up rum.
My next drink of choice was rum.
So I switched to drinking rum.
I shouldn't take Rum's mug.
No house should be without one of these.
It's a skeleton holding a piece of map.
It's not mine to use.
Looks like he died while taking a bath.
Yuck!  I don't want to touch it.
Yuck!  I don't want to touch it.
Yuck!  I don't want to touch it.
Skeletons don't talk.
I can't reach it.
I can see inside Rum's house from here.
I can't reach it.
I can't reach it.
I can't reach it.
I can't reach it.
It says `Trespassers not delivering foodstuffs will be persecuted.`
The gate is closed.
Hey, aren't you supposed to be in jail?
I got time off for good behavior.
You must be confusing me with my cousin Guybrush.
Governor Phatt had me set free.
Yes, but I broke out.
Oh, I see.
The resemblance is uncanny.
Ha ha.
That's a good one.
Walt would have chewed you to bits.
Oh.
Can I go upstairs?
When will the Governor be finished eating?
I think there's a fire in the kitchen.
Look behind you, a three-headed monkey!
I'd love to stay and chat but I'm due at the manicurist's.
I'm sorry, but the Governor doesn't want to be disturbed while he's eating.
I said the Governor is not to be disturbed while he's eating.
Really?
I'd better check it out.
Really?
I'd better fetch the cook!
Maybe you should get a shave while you're at it.
Ha ha ha ha.
Hold it!
You can't go up there.
There are crumbs and condiments all over it.
Ick.
There's food or something stuck in the drain.
It seems to go off before stuff comes out of the tube.
I don't think this has been washed in about ten years.
I don't think I'd better wake him up.
Sleeping like a baby.
...a baby elephant.
Ick.
I don't think I could move him.
I don't think I could move him.
I don't think I could move him.
I don't think I'd better wake him up.
I don't think I'd better wake him up.

Why, yes, Miss Bilkfarm, I'd love another case of eclairs.
Ah, sugarplums...
More!  More spaghetti pie!
Look out for the custard!
And the winner of the weenie-eating contest is...
Governor Phatt!
More sauce on the goose, please.
Cranberries?  Yes, I love cranberries!
Careful with those pitons, or we'll fall into the jelly.
Now I've got to eat my way out of the sea of tapioca pudding.
Why, that's the second biggest pound cake I've ever seen!
Careful with those snacks, Eugene.
Yes, my single-handed defeat of the Fudge Brigade WAS rather amazing.
My kingdom for a peanut butter goat cream truffle!
...and I promise cheese and chocolate sprinkles in every pot...
Show me again how to hypnotize a rhino with an all-day sucker.
When thinking the brain resembles a swiss cheese...
Just back the truck in.
Hello?  I'd like a hundred gallons of butterscotch topping please.
No, you can't have a bite, it's mine.
Get your own, mother.
The world is my chocolate Easter egg.
I think I almost woke him up!
Maybe later.
It's too peaceful out here for that.
I don't want to disturb the fish.
Then why don't you pipe down?
Oooh, I don't want to upset the wheel...
Not in here...
The echo might kill me.
I don't want to push it.
I don't think I should use it indoors.
Au contraire!
This here's an indoor-outdoor model.
Suitable for even the best of my Kozy Krypts!
I think I've been enough of a pest.
I think I should save my breath.
Who knows what enormous deadly cave creature I'd wake up?
No thanks.
Just to let LeChuck know where I am?
No thanks.
I don't think I should use it indoors.
I don't think this is a good spot.
Bad acoustics.
Don't even think about it.
What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
Come here often?
I can hold my breath for ten minutes!
You know, they call me the Bone Master.
You know, I could really fall for a girl like you.
What's your sign?
How'd you like to come up and see my etchings?
Wanna feel my muscles?
Has anyone ever told you you have beautiful eyes?
Wanna see my scar?
Let's get out of here and go someplace where we can talk.
If I said you had a beautiful body would you hold it against me?
Aren't you a famous model?
Wanna help me search for buried treasure?
You look like a pretty classy babe.
You must be a stewardess.
You'd be in good hands with me, baby.
Trying to avoid guys like you.
Once TOO often, obviously.
You'll have to wait a lot longer than that to pick ME up.
I'm surprised anyone calls you at all.
Hopefully off a cliff.
`No trespassing.`
How'd you like a nice Fruit Punch?
Call me when you can find one.
Has anyone ever swallowed that line?
I've seen lobotomies, thanks.
Preferably long distance.
Just the part with the knuckles.
Aren't you a famous jerk?
How would you like to BE buried treasure?
I guess I was wrong when I thought you couldn't possibly be as dumb as you look.
You can go be in your OWN hands, creep.
The sign says `The Booty Boutique.`
`Mementos, Souvenirs, Artifacts`
What?
What are you looking at?
What?
I think she'd slug me.
I think she'd slug me.
I think she'd slug me.
Capsize Charters, glass-bottom boat for sightseeing or special-interest voyages.
There's a picture of her on it.
Gee, I wonder if he's loaded.
Gee, I wonder if it's loaded.
Hey!  Don't touch that!
We only set that off when the mail boat comes in.
What a piece of junk.
Hello again.
Hello there.
I just stopped by to say hello again.
I said HELLO THERE.  My name's Threepwood.
I'd like to introduce myself.  My name's Threepwood.
What kind of mishaps were there at the treasure hunt?
Hey, old man.  How about blowing off the cannon?
And what are the official purposes of this cannon?
Whatcha lookin' at?
You don't have a brother named Marty, do you?
Nothing.  Never mind.  Bye.
Well, I'm off.
Maybe I'll just wait until you do.
Oh, why hello there Threepwood.
You in town for Mardi Gras?
Oh yes.  Well, are you enjoying Mardi Gras?
No, I'm on a treasure hunt!
Hey, if it's a party, I'm there.
Is this the right time of year for Mardi Gras?
What kind of mishaps were there at the treasure hunt?
That's where I'm going right now.  Bye.
Yep.  Can't talk now.  Having too much fun.
You kids today...
...always on the go-go-go.
What?  They doin' a treasure hunt again this year?
I can't believe they'd try that again after all the mishaps last time.
Dang!  There goes all my fun.
I meant a REAL treasure hunt.  You know.  For money.
What kind of mishaps?
Well, I'd better let you get back to work...
Well, if it's a party your looking for...
Son, it's always Mardi Gras on Booty Island.
Well, if it's fun you're looking for...
Well, there's always Governor Marley's party.
I hear Governor Marley is having some super shindig up at her mansion.
Marley?  That's funny.  I used to date a Governor Marley.
How do you know so much about parties?
Maybe I'll just go up there now.  Bye.
Sounds fun.
Maybe I'll go there right now.
Yeah, live it up while you're young.
Yeah, live it up while you're young.
Oh sure...
And I'll bet you helped her beat LeChuck, too.
You'd better believe it!
No, I beat him all by myself!
Don't laugh.  I've got the proof right here...
You're right.  I'm lying.  I'm so ashamed.
...in my pock--
'--whoops.  Uh...
Hey, hey, kid.  It's OK.
Mardi Gras is the time for fantasy.
Now just run along and enjoy yourself.
I used to be the governor of this island.
But I never had any time to come down here and enjoy the party.
So I quit, and now I watch out for the mail boat.
Which reminds me, I have to get back to work.
For money?
Look, son, this ain't some back alley on Phatt.
If you're looking for gambling you've come to the wrong place.
Well, some people got carried away...
...some graves got dug up...
...horrible business.
How about just blowing off?
My name is Augustus DeWaat, not `old man.`
And this cannon is for official purposes only.
I watch the sea, and when the mail boat arrives, I blow this cannon.
Dang ship's three days late.
Boy, the only Marty I know is Marty Graw!
Who?
Mardi Gras!
It's a joke, boy, a joke.
You are here for Mardi Gras, aren't you?
Well, enjoy Mardi Gras.
Sorry son, didn't have my horn out.
Could you say that again?
Eh, what was that?
You talking to me, boy?
You again?
Still mumbling, I see.
Speak up!
There is a party going on, remember.
What was that?
Are you lost?
How am I supposed to keep my ear to the sea with you bugging me all the time?
Eh?
Cruises!
Sightseeing!
Sunken Galleons!
Glass-bottom boat!
Check it out!
See the world!
Three-hour tours!
Last day before I leave for Phatt Island!
By the way, my name's Guybrush.
Hi, my name's Guybrush.
Could I have one of those leaflets?
I'm ready to head out again.
I'm ready to set sail!
I'm interested in chartering a ship.
Are you the same Kate who bought all the near-grog at the Bloody Lip?
I'm searching for the treasure of Big Whoop.
I just remembered I'm late for a party.
I'm Captain Kate Capsize.
Like to charter a ship?
I do weddings, funerals, bar mitzvahs, you name it.
Yeah, OK.
Hey, these things cost money.
Great!
Not many people want to charter a glass-bottomed boat around here.
Pretty soon I'm off to Phatt Island to try my luck there, but let's talk turkey first.
Yeah, and you can't have any of it, so don't ask.
You and everybody else on this island.
If you need a ship, you know where to find me.
OK, show me where you want to go this time.
Yeah?
When I was first mate on the Limping Limpet we went in search of Big Whoop.
We'd heard it was buried under a place called Blinky Island.
Never found the island OR the treasure.
The captain eventually died of boredom while we were crossing the Sea of Beige Flotsam.
Hope your luck is better.
My fee is 6000 pieces of eight.
As I mentioned, my fee is 6000 pieces of eight.
Don't you think 6000 pieces of eight is a bit high?
I'm afraid I don't have any money.
I don't have that much money.
I don't have that much.
All I have is {var:global_305} pieces of eight.
OK, I'll pay you the 6000 pieces of eight.
Do you give credit?
I'll come back later.
No, I don't.
Well, perhaps you'd better get some.
I guess you'd better find some more, then, huh?
You've chartered yourself a ship.
My name's Kate Capsize, I'll be your Captain.
Are you ready to leave now?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
OK, I'll be here.
Yeah, I'm hot to find the wreck of the Mad Monkey!
Yeah, let's blow this popsicle stand.
No, I need to take care of a few things first.
I'm not sure where I want to go.
Have you got a course planned or anything?
I can show you where I want to go on this map that Captain Dread gave me.
Let me know when you're ready to head out.
I'll be here.
You'd best figure that out, then come back and let me know.
I don't need any more money from you.
I take it you want to charter my ship.
All right, that's six thousand pieces of eight.
Thanks!
You've just chartered yourself a ship!
If you want to charter my ship, it'll cost you six thousand pieces of eight.
I don't recognize this at all.
You'd better take it to an expert.
Thanks, I've already got some.
Thanks, but no thanks.
I have a treasure guarantee policy with all my charters.
Since you came back empty-handed, we can go out again, free of charge.
Just let me know if you want to go.
Let me know when you're ready to try again.
Well, congratulations on your find, Guybrush.
Be sure and tell any friends you might have about Capsize Charters.
See you around the turnpike.
Hmmm...  Maybe THAT'S the mail boat.
That sounds like the mail boat!
I'd better fire the cannon!
That oughta do it.
Course, I don't see no mail boat...
Well, where's the mail boat?
Thought I heard it...
Was THAT it?
Uh... Maybe?
I see.

Ah, the whole world loves a spitting contest.
I'm not looking for a fight.
It's a plaque with an odd-looking gob of something on it.
For what?  A paperweight?
Sorry, kid.
Only one plaque to a spitter.
I'll give it a try.
A volunteer!
Alright, settle down folks.
This kid looks like a serious contender.

The Phlegmster!
The Phlegmalizer!
The Master of Phlegm!
The Loogster!
Loog-o-rama!
Hockin' the big ones for fame and fortune!
Oh, no.  Dry tongue at the last minute!
Well, what about you folks?
(ahem)
Dribble Boy is back!
Juicious Maximus has returned!
The Phlegm Master, ready for his comeback!
Captain Loogie is in the house!
Spit away!
Swish-swish.
Hooooooock!
Chwwwwwwk!
Ptooie!
Spit?  That's gross!  I'm outta here.
Spit?  That's gross!  I'm outta here.
Misfire!  Misfire!
Everybody run!
Maybe a little over the max on the juice, there.
Well, so much for the Phlegm Master.
Gee, that's too bad, Captain.
Well, better luck next time, Dribble Boy.
Let's give him a big hand anyway, folks.
At least he tried.
He's cleared first place!
That was truly awe-inspiring!
Sports fans, we've seen something incredible here today!
Let me congratulate you and give you this fine commemorative plaque.
I think you've earned the title `Phlegm Master` now.
You truly are the Master of Phlegm.
I salute you, Captain Loogie.
Way to go, Juicious.
Come on, let's give him a hand.
Of course, there are plenty more prizes for the rest of you.
So how about it, gang?
What's this?  A surprise turnaround in performance?
It looks like he's rallying!
Hey, he's been working out!
Oh, and I thought he was going to go all the way.
Looks like someone stopped practicing.
Oooh, he's slipping folks.
Well, no records here.
At least he's consistent.
Once again...
Looks like second place.
Looks like third place.
That doesn't quite qualify.
...but...
I think that deserves a little applause...
Too bad there are only prizes for first place.
Better luck next time.
Now, how about the rest of you?
I'm sick of that old codger and his false alarms!
Sounds like old Augustus spotted the mail boat!
Again?
False alarm.
As I was saying...
I don't want to push it.
Cheat?  With everyone watching?
I'd better not move them any farther...
...these guys are dumb, but not THAT dumb.
OK, now who's gonna be next?
It's a great day for spitting!
Just look at this juicy crowd!
Step up to the line and test your swill!
Valuable prizes!
Even a child can do it!
In fact, they do it very well!
Come on.  It's all paid for by Booty Island Parks and Rec!
Just put your two lips together and blow!
Are you pirates or not?
Two, four, six, eight!
Come on, let's expectorate!
Everybody already has the necessary equipment.
Turn a disgusting habit into a prestige-winning skill!
Don't let this grass wither up and die!
What was that?  Did I hear somebody swallow?
What a waste!
Thousands will spit.  Hundreds will win!
No volunteers?  If Blackbeard were here he'd shoot you all right now.
Don't be shy!  Let it fly!
I know you want to volunteer...
...it's on the tip of your tongue.
You think spitting is gross?
I'll tell you what's gross--
Swallowing that stuff is gross.
Prove to me that you guys are at least as fun as a pack of llamas.
I hear there are some scouts here from the pro spitting circuit...
This may be your last chance at popularity and success!
Me!  Me!
Sure looks enthusiastic about spitting.
I'm not stupid enough to fall for my own trick!
Let's go!
You can do it!
You stink!
What are you waiting for?
Let's go!
You can do it!
You stink!
What are you waiting for?
Let's go!
You can do it!
You stink!
What are you waiting for?
Spit!
Better not blow it, man.
Hummm, baby!
I don't think he's got the lips for it.
Spit!
Better not blow it, man.
Hummm, baby!
I don't think he's got the lips for it.
Spit!
Better not blow it, man.
Hummm, baby!
I don't think he's got the lips for it.
Come on!
Hey spitter hey spitter hey spitter...
Right on!
C'mon!  What are you?  Afraid?
Shouldn't he be disqualified by now?
Let 'er rip!
We're with ya, Juicious!
Alright, Phlegm-master!
C'mon, Captain Loogie!
You show 'em, Dribble Boy!
Come on!

`Beware of Parrot`
It's firmly attached to the wall.
I paid for it.
I don't have to put it back.
I don't want to hang that there.
It has a picture of a parrot on the front.
Would you mind leaving that here?
The parrot likes it even better than the mirror.
I think he likes it where it is.

It's not mine to use.
It may be old, but it's still shiny and sharp.
I don't think I should cut that.
I don't think he'd like that.
He looks like he's really into this stuff.
Call me Stingy,
but I'm not giving away my money.
That's worth way too much to give back.
That's not mine to give away.
What?!!
Am I nuts?
I'm not that stupid.
I'm not giving that away.
I already have too many of those.
I can't take that back.
Some of the teeth are bent.
Actually, this might come in handy later.
I'd like to keep this so I can look at myself.
Sorry kid.
I don't do sports nostalgia.
Get that piece of junk out of here.
Hey!  That's thing's not sanitary anymore!
Get it away from me!
No, thanks.
I wouldn't want to do anything that would devalue it.
It belongs to the antique dealer now.
I wouldn't want to do anything that would devalue it.

Soil the King's image?
Sacrilege!
It's never too early to prepare for the holidays.
As what?  A hat?
`Inspected by 27`
Nah.  I have a thing about lice.
This might make a nice wall hanging.
I don't have a use for it.
Just like the pen from Mom and Dad's wedding!
No ink.
Nothing much to write about, anyway.
`Made in Hong Kong`
The Maaaaaad Monkey!
Beeeauuuutiful
Pretty bird.
SQUAWK!
Hook Peter.
BRAAAACK!
Big Whoop.
Rock and Roll rules.
Scale skull skin.
A whale by any other name.
Don't blow a fuse.
They're great!
Last noise.
Iron cast.
Barter.
Every shape.
Third wheel.
A good friend.
Real holy raid.
It's empty.
Ship horn.
Pinhead.
Stopping power.
Holidays, smalidays.
Sea saw.
Never call it dead until it drops.
Famous pirates not for sale.
Wenches, smenches.
Pirate.
Exactly what is it?
Vase.
Polly want a cracker?
How much is it?
Credit.  Credit.  Credit.
Do you accept?
Trade for map piece?
About ship.
How much is the map piece?
Do you take credit?
What kind of trade-ins do you accept?
What would you trade for the map piece?
Can you tell me about the ship with the figurehead?
Please tell me about the ship with the figurehead again.
Nice shop you got here.
I have to go now.
I have to go now.
The map piece is made of authentic parchment from the turn of the century.
Can't find things like that anymore.
Yah, but how much is it?
About six million pieces o' eight.
Um... I don't think I have that much to spend.
Well... I do have some nice fake maps for less.
No thanks.
Yeah, like you have one.
But I do accept personal checks or trade-ins.
I'll take most old swords,
some used parrots,
almost anything valuable made of bronze,
and a few old ship parts.
Would you give me the map piece for any of those things?
No.  But there's one thing I might trade for the map piece.
There was a certain ship that sunk and I'd really like the figurehead.
I'd give you the map if you got the figurehead for me.
The ship was a huge galleon named The Mad Monkey.
Nobody knows where it sank or why.
But, the figurehead is supposed to be the most fabulous piece of art ever.
That's why I want it.
I'm a collector of fine art, as I'm sure you can see.
What a coincidence!
I just so happen to have that very figurehead.
Thanks.  I pride myself on the quality of my merchandise.
I only sell the finest of pirate memorabilia.
Even the trade-ins are first class.
And I always make you the best deals.
How can you afford to do that?
Volume.
The figurehead from the Mad Monkey!
Ordinarily, I'd pay six million pieces o' eight for this.
But I'm a bit short on the cash right now.
I'll give you this Big Whoop map piece for it.
Sure.  I'll take the map piece.
Well, well, well.
I didn't think anyone would ever get the Mad Monkey's figurehead.
Can I get the map piece now?
Sure.
It's yours.
Isn't he a beautiful parrot?
He's preoccupied with his reflection.
I think he's in love.
Isn't he a beautiful parrot?
He's preoccupied with his reflection.
I think he's in love.
Mr. Polly likes that mirror.
Yeah, he seems to be in love with his reflection.
It says, `Beware of Parrot.`
That's an authentic pirate's fishhook.
Found it inside a crocodile who was too petered out to move.
Thanks for giving that to me.
I think the parrot likes it.
That's part of the Big Whoop treasure map.
I don't know a lot about the piece, but there's supposed to be a book in the library that tells all about the whole map.
That collectible plate is worth a mint.
Wow!  I knew those would be valuable one day.
Those are authentic scale reproductions of rotting skulls rendered in sun-bleached whalebone.
There's even some loose skin to hang them up from.
That's the legendary white whale.
Never been caught, except on canvas.
Does it have a name?
Dunno.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Nothing says a whale must have a name.
That's a Mark VII `devastator` triple-cannon emplacement.
If only they'd thought to leave a hole for the fuse.
You'd look good in one of those.
And they're great for parties.
I made that myself from my last parrot.
Got too noisy for me.
Check out these balls!
They're made of a fine iron cast.
I was told that these are used as a form of barter in the inner cities.
I have an eyepatch in every shape.
I got that as a gift from a man I saved few years ago.
Don't have much use for a wheel, but he said one good turn deserves another.
It was handmade by a good friend of mine from another island.
That's the real thing!
As seen in `Raiders`, `Temple`, `Holy Grail`, and `The Young Chronicles`.
It's said that the infamous Greenbeard won that barrel from Long John Cooper in a poker game.
Shame that it's empty.
That's a real ship's horn just like the ones used on modern ships.
It looks like Spiffy the Pinhead.
It's empty.
It's ergonomically formulated to enhance stopping power.
That's a great gift for the holidays.
Found that beauty at the bottom of the sea.
She cleaned up real nicely though.
That's a sign I took from the famous Precipice View Road.
I've never heard of it.
They call it `Dead Man's Drop` now.
Ah, the famous ceremonial lights from the pirates of the South Pacific.
Those aren't for sale.
It's a picture of a couple of wenches.
It's a picture of a pirate with peg legs.
I'm not sure exactly what this is.
It's a beautiful antique porcelain vase.
I'd like to buy this...
...thing.
I'd like to buy these gross skulls.
I'd like to buy these pirate hats.
I'd like to buy these cannon balls.
I'd like to buy these hub caps.
I'd like to buy these eye patches.
I'd like to buy these tiki lights.

I'd like to buy this well-polished old saw.
I'd like to buy this `left turn` sign.
I'd like to buy this small picture frame.
I'd like to buy this vase.
Sorry, that sign's not for sale.
Oh.
Well, ah...
I guess I could sell it.
You already bought the last one I have for sale.
I need to keep at least one for a display model.
Actually, those belong to my son.
They aren't for sale.
I just keep those here because they're cool.
They're not for sale.
I just couldn't part with those.
They have sentimental value.
Yah, I like that too.
But it's not for sale.
That's one of my favorite things in the store.
But I don't have enough back stock to sell it.
That's great, huh?
Too bad it's not for sale.
I only have one of those.
So I need to keep it as a display model.
That's 6,000,000 pieces o' eight.
Do you want it?
Excellent choice.
I see you have an eye for quality.
Alrighty.
Okeydokey.
Great!
And I'd like to sell you one of them.
And I'd like to sell it to you.
That'll be 15 pieces o' eight.
I can't afford that much.
That'll be 5 pieces o' eight.
Too bad.
If you really want it, I could buy back some of the stuff you bought from me.
That'll be 100 pieces o' eight.
That'll be 20000 pieces o' eight.
OK.  I'll take it.
That'll be 199 pieces o' eight.
On second thought, I'd better save my money.
They're 30 pieces o' eight each.
Your loss.
That'll be 10 pieces o' eight.
They're 50 pieces o' eight each.
It's yours.
Let me get you one from overstock.
That'll be 40 pieces o' eight.
Here you go.
That'll be 20 pieces o' eight.
That'll be 25 pieces o' eight.
Thank you.
How much will you give me for this plaque?
I'm not interested.
What do you mean?  It's worth a mint!
You'd be interested if you knew how valuable it was.
OK, but you're missing a great deal here.
For a lump of pus on a shingle?
That's not just any lump of pus.
It's better than most of the junk in here.
Fine.  Your loss, buddy.
Oh yeah?
What's so special about it?
The spit of the person who killed LeChuck is on it.
It's made out of rare, ecologically safe materials.
Actually, it's so valuable, I'd better keep it.
Really?!
That would make it very valuable.
And I do like bronze, anyway.
I'll give you 6000 pieces o' eight for it.
It's a deal.
Uh-huh.

Leave me alone.  I saw that already.
Sorry, no returns.
No, thank you.
I don't want to pin him.
Excuse me...
You can pick up your costume anytime.
Hope you're enjoying your costume.
I'd like to rent a costume.
I'd really like to rent a costume.
I'd really REALLY like to rent a costume.
I NEED to rent a costume.
I HAVE TO rent a costume.
My life depends on renting a costume.
Did I ask you about renting a costume yet?
Um, I'm looking for a costume.
PLEASE rent me a costume.
But you have tons of costumes.
Why are your costumes so popular?
You look busy.  I'll come back later.
Our costumes are all gone or on reserve.
I hear there're invitations available in the gambling alley on Phatt Island.
One reserved costume per invitation.
Sorry.
Try us after Mardi Gras.
Or get an invitation at the casino on Phatt Island.
Look.  If you don't have a reservation, you don't have a costume.
I said, I'm all out.
I told you, we don't have any more costumes.
Can't you see I'm busy?
Sorry, can't help you.
Next time make a reservation.
I don't have a costume for you.
They're all reserved and waiting to be picked up.
I'm the only costume shop in a five-island radius.
And besides, everybody who's anybody is going to the big Mardi Gras celebration at Governor Marley's mansion.
Ah, you have a costume on reserve!
Well, that's a different story!
Let's see...
Your costume is right over here...
Walk this way, please.
Well, here it is.
You'll surely be the talk of the party in this.
Well, have fun and enjoy your costume.
This is really nice.
Neat.
I like this one.
Great costume.
I had one like that when I was a kid.
I think this one's my favorite.
I wonder if I can rent this one.
Spacious.
I'm no magician.
I'm not ready for that yet.
Hey, take your time.  No hurry.
Nice finish.
I'm no magician.
Are you still out there?
Hello?
Bye now!
Uh... be there in a minute.
I don't want to get in trouble.
It's open and empty.
It's locked.
It's locked.

`Stan's Kozy Krypts-- A Place to Spend Eternity, Not a Fortune.`
I nailed them in there pretty good.
Don't think I can get them out.
They must have fused with the teflon gasket!
Oh Lord, I'm doomed!
I nailed them in there pretty good.
Don't think I can get them out.

That's disgusting!
`When the tears come, shouldn't you be prepared?
'-Stans Previously-Owned Coffins.`
It's nailed shut!
I almost forgot.
I wanted you to have this complimentary hankie.
Just my way of saying, `I care.`
Now, where were we?
Oh yeah.
Sure, sure.  Try out the lid operation.
It's just as roomy closed.
HOWDY!!!
Welcome to Stan's Previously Owned Coffins!
We handle the dead for a lot less bread.
What are you looking for, son?
Need a bin for your next of kin?
Want a family plot without spending a lot?
You're in luck!
Just look at all this quality merchandise!
Never before touched by a living soul.
Most of it used only for a few hours...
...premature burial, you know.  That sort of thing.
Well, speak up.  Or are you dead?
Either way, you came to the right place.
Well, well, well.
I knew you'd come back.
My customers always do.
...EVENTUALLY.
Hey, welcome back!
Could you show me that coffin again?
How much is that coffin?
I'm looking for a good used coffin.
Actually, I'd just like to browse.
Didn't you used to be a used-ship salesman?
Do you do funerals?
I'm not actually in the market for a coffin yet.
I need to get something embalmed.
I gotta go.  See you later.
Amazing!
When you first walked in here I said, `Now THERE'S a guy who needs a good used coffin!`
There happens to be an excellent deal right behind you.
Let's go take a look-see.
Now this here...
...is the Cadillac of Coffins.
Look at all that leg room!
There's room in there for Long John Silver himself!
Here--let me get in and show you.
Now this isn't just your average sixty-gallon coffin.
This has the full seventy-five gallons you need to avoid unsightly bone readjustments.
Good solid construction on this baby.
`It keeps out the worms while your body firms.`
I have to warn you, I've got five other dead guys coming to look at this today.
Have you decided to buy?
Could you get in and show me how big it is again?
Can I show you anything else?
Well, it's complicated...
Pricing here at Stan's works on a sliding scale...
...based on one's ability to pay...
...so as to make a decent funeral affordable to even our poorest customers.
That's very considerate of you.
So, how much dough do you have on you?
I don't have much.
I have {var:global_305} pieces of eight.
They JUST raised the casket tax.
Now this baby's going for 6500 pieces of eight.
Oooh, that hurts.
Now that baby's going for {var:global_484} pieces of eight.
Now that baby's going for {var:global_484} pieces of eight.
Actually, I'm one of those poor customers you were talking about.
I see.
I think cremation might be more appropriate in this instance.
Of course we do funerals!
And not just those somber, all-black, three-handkerchief affairs...
We do it in a rowdy Mardi Gras style, with music and dancing and pallbearer races...
I like to say we put the FUN in FUNerals.
Heh heh.
Well, you came to the right place!
`Your loved ones deserve Stan's special preserve.`
`You won't smell a whiff When we're done with your stiff.`
I never knew morticians were so clever.
Sorry...
Health regulations prohibit me from allowing uncertified persons free access to used internment paraphernalia.
Aw, shucks.
It's never too early to make funeral arangements.
Making plot reservations now insures you a space at our popular Scabb Island Internment Park...
...as well as entitling you to discounts on park rentals.
Rentals?
You know--for barbecues, parties--that sort of thing.
Well, yeah.
But I decided to get into a business where unsatisfied customers are less likely to come back and complain.
Here, take this complimentary hankie.
Just my way of saying, `I care.`
Maybe sooner than you think.
Yes, a man can really rest in peace AND comfort with one of these.
Why should a man's coffin be any smaller than his bunk at sea?
I could spend a lot of time in a coffin like this.
Look at how freely I can wiggle my toes.
This thing's bigger than my kitchen!
You know, a person's coffin should reflect their station in life.
If you're thinking about one of those cheaper models, first ask yourself,
`Isn't my loved one worth the best?`
This is truly the casket of captains.
When you've spent your life on something as big as the ocean,
how can you spend your death in anything smaller?
There's enough room in here for a pirate AND his parrot.
Feel free to join me.  There's room for both of us!
I could just stay in here all day.
If you should ever need to turn in your grave...
...you could in here with comfort and ease.
Even though it is used, you'll notice it still has that new coffin smell.
I don't mean to scare you, but anything smaller than this and we might have to cut off your loved one's feet.
Take it from me, I'm as claustrophobic as they come, and I love it in here.
This baby's so nice, it should be illegal--
It makes people want to die.
I've got one of these in the back for when I go.
Just take a look at this convenient beverage holder.
We also stock an excellent worm repellent that I might just throw in for free.
You gotta admit, it's cozy.
Do I not look cozy in here?
It's already nailed shut.
But I don't have a hammer.
But I don't have any nails.
But it's open.
It's just as roomy closed.
Here, let me show you...
See?
I hear you knocking up there.
That's solid oak you're hearing!
Yes it sure is nice in here.
Hey!  I think the lid's stuck!
Uh...  Excuse me, friend...
Could you see if the clasp is closed on this thing?
I seem to be stuck...
Hello?
Is there anybody out there?
Yoo-hoo?
Help!
I can't get out of here!
OK, a joke's a joke, now GET ME OUT OF HERE!
Open this coffin right now!
Anybody?
I really am claustrophobic.
Someone's going to pay for this.
I'd bust out of here, but the dang thing's built too well.
Well, if I had to be stuck in a coffin, at least it's the deluxe model.
It really is pretty roomy in here.
Maybe I'll take a nap.
I hope this thing's not airtight.
I'm not dead!
I'm losing valuable business.
Let me out!  I need to go to the bathroom.
Hey, kid.  Don't be touching that.
Sure!
Okeydokey!
Alrighty...
Yessiree!
Heck, why not?
No problemo!
What an excellent idea!
I was just going to suggest that myself.
Of course!
Hey, anything you say!
Dang.  Looks like it's empty.
Of course it is!
I just went to the bank!
Now get me out of here!
Nothing inside.
Nothing inside.
Is there something I can help you with?
I'm here for the Governor's party.
You mentioned a party before...
You mentioned a party before...
Nice costume.  Almost scared me to death.
What are you guarding here?
Elaine Marley?  From M0xEAl0xE9e Island?
Party?  What party?
Elaine Marley?  From M0xEAl0xE9e Island?
Elaine Marley?  From M0xEAl0xE9e Island?
Gotta go.  Keep up the good work.
Elaine Marley, of course.
Yup.  The same heroic Elaine Marley who killed the Ghost Pirate LeChuck.
But, I killed LeChuck!
Why would Governor Marley lie?
Jealousy?
Revenge?
Fame and fortune?
For attention?
In your dreams.
I'm guarding Governor Marley's mansion.
Thanks.
Where's your costume for the Governor's party?
Governor Marley is having a huge Mardi Gras party.
Invitation only... costumes required... that sort of thing.
You mean Governor Marley's Mardi Gras fish fry?
It's invitation only and costumes are required.
Did you bring a costume and invitation?
Did you bring a costume?
Did you bring an invitation?
I've got my invitation right here.
I don't have an invitation.
I have my costume right here.
This is my costume.
Uh, I didn't want to go anyway.
Suit yourself.
Well, what do you know?
You do have an invitation.
Do you have a costume?
Then you can't go past me.
Nobody would willingly wear such a dopey costume.
Better put it on.
Well, if you insist.
But you'll have to try to restrain yourself.
No, no!  Not here!
Go in the bushes or something.
Geeze...
Oh, that is nice.
And the boots are a nice touch.
Do you have an invitation?
OK, I guess you can go through.
Have fun.
THE GHOST PIRATE LECHUCK!!!!
Get a grip.
Don't you know a Mardi Gras costume when you see one?
I'd rather not wear this costume in public.
Well, shoot.
Maybe while I'm in the woods I'll ditch this stupid costume.
I should probably stay in costume, for now.
What's the matter, boy?
Smell something?
Uh... nice doggie...
What's the matter there, Guybrush?
Nothing a big hug wouldn't cure.
LeChuck's alive and I'm on the lam!
This crazy mutt is trying to kill me!
How did you know my name?
I was talking to the dog.
Who are you?
She named her DOG Guybrush?
Mr. Threepwood.  Take me to the Governor right away.
I'm Governor Marley's ex-boyfriend.  She's expecting me.
I'm selling these fine pink dresses.
I'm here for the party.  Want to see my invitation?
Yeah, I don't get it either.
It's not much of a name if you ask me.
She says it's cause he's dumb and helpless and keeps getting in the way.
But he sure can sniff out the Governor's possessions.
Maybe you should empty your pockets.
I was just about to suggest the very same thing.
But first, why don't you empty your pockets?
Sure, sure, loverboy.
I'll just take you right up to see her.
No thanks.  It's not on my color wheel.
But let's just see what you have in your pockets.
That's a good idea.
While you're at it, why don't you show me everything you have in your pockets?
Try and catch me, old man!
Oh, look out for that rake.
Aw, what a cute little thing.
Don't you patronize me.
I'm a scholar.
Now why would I want to pick on such a cute little puppy?
Now why would I want to pick on such a cute little puppy?
I'm fetching enough already in this dress.
That doesn't seem to smell interesting to him.
I'd better not.
I'd better not.
He's got a rake.
I'd better not.
He's got a rake.
I'd better not.
He's got a rake.
I'd better not.
He's got a rake.
I'd better not.
He's got a rake.
I'd better not.
He's got a rake.
I'd better not.
He's got a rake.
I'd better not.
He's got a rake.
Leave me alone.
I'm busy.
I'd better not.
He's got a rake.
Hey!
It looks like it's about to blow away.
Hey, that's a good idea.
Whoops.  Too late.
What the...
Hey...
Dang wind.
Come back here!
Slippery little devil...
Hold still.
OK, that does it.
I think I've had enough fun with this poor little dog already.
You'd better not touch that dog!
I'm warning you--he bites!
I'd like to, but this dress just doesn't have the pockets for it.
I'd like to, but this dress just doesn't have the pockets for it.
I'm going to ditch this thing once and for all.
OK, dog.
You're coming with me.
I thought I told you to beat it!
You keep away from that dog!
I don't think he's interested.
Ha!
Bark as loud as you want!
Filbert's out raking the back forty.
There you go again!
Cut that out!
Aren't you listening to me?
I'm about to stick that thing in your ear!
Don't even THINK about going in there!
It IS closed.
It's a beat-up metal trash can.
No way.
It probably smells.
It says, `Dear Booty Island Waste Disposal Service:
Shhhh!
Please don't bang garbage cans.
Governor sleeping upstairs.`
They're empty.
No thanks.  They reek of fish.
It's empty.
No thanks.  It reeks of fish.
I think I've been enough of a pest.
CRASH!
CRASH!
CRASH!
CRASH!
I said cut that out!
Hey!  What's all the racket?
You again?!
Oh, there you are.
Anyway, like I was saying...
There you go again!
Cut that out!
Aren't you listening to me?
I'm about to stick that thing in your ear!
Hey!  Come back here!  I'm not done yet!
Don't mess with the Governor's cans!
Don't be blowing nothing around here!
Who do you think you are?
You better just get out of here!
No good punk.
If it's not raccoons, it's teenage vandals!
You call that music or something?
You heard me.  Get lost.
Transient hooligan.
Why I oughtta...
You've got some nerve.
I don't have time for this.
Go away boy.  You bother me.
Beat it!
I'm going to use this meat cleaver in a second.
This neighborhood has really gone downhill.
Get a job!
Why don't you go down to the dump if you like garbage cans so much?
Why don't you go join a parade if you like blowing horns so much?
SCRAM!
Don't you have anything better to do?
Kids today!
Does your mother know where you are?
I'm sick of looking at you already.
Bothering innocent people's trash...
Bothering innocent people with blaring music...
Why don't you shove off?
What's the matter?  No parlay Englais?
I said scram!
Vammoose!
Try sticking your head in a cannon if you like loud noises.
Don't let me catch you hanging around the Governor's party, either.
Take a hike!
OK, that's it.  I'm calling the cops!
Make yourself scarce.
You'd better go before I lose my temper.
I'll beat you like an egg!
This is a respectable place, hear me?
We don't take to your kind here.
Buzz off!
Shoo!
Yeah, I'm talking to you!
Amscray!
I think I hear your mother calling.
Go get a haircut!
I'm warning you--I can debone a chicken in fifteen seconds with my bare hands.
OK, that's it.  No more Mr. Nice Guy.
This is your last chance--I'm running out of spit.
Hmpf!
Punk.
Let this be a lesson to you.
You're lucky I have to get back to my fish!
And, well...
...just don't you forget it!
The nerve...
I can't get by these people on the stairs.
It looks like part of the map to Big Whoop!
It's not mine to use.
Looks like I'm too late for the hors d'oeuvres.
Too late--they're already picked clean.
They seem to be enjoying the party.
I'm not dressed for wrestling.
I'm not dressed for wrestling.
I'm not dressed for wrestling.
Can I just squeeze by?
Get a room.
Can I see both of your ID's, please?
Haven't you ever heard of mono?
Step aside, please.
OK, party's over.  Time to go home.
Nice costume.
Nice costume.
Nice costume.
Nice costume.
Nice costume.
Nice costume.
Nice costume.
Nice costume.
I'm gonna sweat off twenty pounds in this stupid costume!
No kidding.
I forgot to put airholes in mine.
Why do we put up with this stuff?
I dunno.
I guess to prove we're fun-loving guys?
You check out the spitting contest?
Yeah.  Got second place.
Not bad!
Yeah, well, you know.
The wind was with me.
Nice mask.
Thanks.
More subtle than most.
Yes, thanks.
Not your usual, larger-than-life,
Mardi Gras head.
Nope.
Probably saved a lot on materials, huh?
I'm sure I don't know.
Not that paper mache is very expensive...
Do you mean `Papier-M0xE2ch0xE9'
Yeah, whatever.
No, I don't imagine that it's very expensive at all.
Still, you must have saved a bundle.
I never scrimp when it comes to the holidays.
Well, I didn't mean you were cheap...
Parties and balls are my life.
I just meant...
Making gay is the only purpose I can find in my wretched, well-to-do life.
I'm sure it must be hard--
But you say my costume looks cheap.
No, no.  It looks great!
That's not what you said before.
I just said it looked... subtle.
Can't we just drop the subject?
Yeah.  OK.  Fine.

That's true.
There might be some babes here.
But what can we do about it?
Well...  we just ask.
Ask?
What are you, nuts?
Yeah.  I guess you're right.
Sigh.
Mardi Gras sure is tough on us swingers.
I'll drink to that.

Hi.  My name's Guybrush.
Don't I know you from somewhere?
Where'd you get that drink?
So how do you know Elaine?
Anyone seen the Governor?
Tried the fish?
This is some house, wouldn't you say?
So, when do we bob for apples?
Say, did you make that costume yourself?
Hey!  Let's form a bunny hop line!
Well, it's been nice talking to you.
Gotta go now.
Is there a bathroom in here?
What did you say your name was?
I just heard the funniest story...
This is fun.
We should all do this more often, don't you think?
So are you wearing anything under there?
I can see the map fluttering around in the front yard.
I can see Governor Marley's front yard.
Comfy.
I'd better not muss up Elaine's sheets.
You know, I heard some guys talking about Marley's bust...
...this must be it.
I don't want to break anything.
Elaine would kill me.
I don't want to break anything.
Elaine would kill me.
I don't want to break anything.
Elaine would kill me.
It's impolite to stare at a woman's chest.
It's just a porcelain replica of a chest.
I hate that knick-knacky junk.
The last time I stole something from Governor Marley I almost ended up as fish food.
Man, she has shoulder pads in everything.
I think I'm wearing enough women's clothes right now.
I'm warm enough in the one I have on.
I think I'm wearing enough women's clothes right now.
I'm warm enough in the one I have on.
Nothing back here.
I'd like to, but I'd better stay in costume.
I'm pretty comfortable in what I have on.

`Central Caribbean School for Governors...
...Crew '67`
Well, maybe she won't miss this old thing.
Governor, I caught one of your party guests making off with your grandfather's map.
Another would-be treasure hunter, eh?
Bring him in.
In here, Guybrush!
Guybrush!
Guybrush Threepwood?!?
The one and only, sugarbear!
Of all the parties in all the houses on all the islands in the Caribbean...
...he had to crash mine!
It's destiny, honeycakes!
Don't talk to me.
Snugglepuss!
Get lost.
Punkydoodle!
I'm warning you...
Pooper-dooper!
Maybe I should go rake the back forty.
Look at us, together again.
Boy.  We haven't been like this since...
...well...
Since I quit my job and moved away without leaving a forwarding address?
Was that what happened?  Gee, I thought...
Guybrush!  Can't you take a hint?
We were a mistake!
I thought we had an agreement.
Maybe I wasn't clear enough the last time...
Boy, you really can't take a hint.
Aren't you supposed to be history?
Don't you ever give up?
Why can't you just leave me alone?
I thought I smelled something.
Oh, Guybrush...
I know I shouldn't have anything to do with you...
...but there's something about your weakness and ineptitude that I find infectious.
Does that mean you're going to let me have the map?
The map!
Is that what this is all about?
I should have known better!
If the map's all you care about...
...you'd better go out and get it.
That's it!
I've had enough.
Get your mangy hide outta my house.
OK, that's enough!
Get out of here!
That's the last straw!
Beat it or be sorry.
I can't take it anymore!
Hit the road!
You have three seconds to leave my room.
One...
Two...
Three...
Oh really?
I guess that's supposed to make up for everything?
Nice try, but I think you're too late.
Decide to act civilized for a change, eh?
Oh, so now you're a good guy?
You should have thought of that sooner.
Do you really think you can get on my good side now?
So much for a pleasant attitude.
And here I thought you were becoming a decent guy.
Ooooh, it's going to be that way, is it?
There goes any hope for a pleasant conversation.
This is getting ugly.
I should have known you weren't sincere.
You're getting warmer...
Well, that's not the MOST stupid thing you've ever said.
That's a LITTLE better...
Hmmm...  keep going.
Close.  You're getting close.
Pathetic.
Do you really expect me to fall for that?
Oh, please.
Is that supposed to make me swoon?
Yeah, right.
Give me a break, will ya?
Uh-huh.  Sure.
What book did you steal that out of?
You've been watching too much daytime television.
Oh, gag me.
That may work on other women, but not me.
Really, I'm touched
...NOT!
That's sweet.
Now scram.
What a line!
I can't believe it--you're even more of a weenie than before.
You're going to have to try a little harder than that.
I'm warning you--you're getting on my nerves.
OK, you're really pushing it now, buddy.
You're this close to getting a sock in the jaw.
One more crack like that and you'll be bouncing down those stairs.
You're on the verge of hospitalization, Guy.
I see you're charming as ever.
Now that wasn't very pleasant.
Maybe you'd better leave.
I can't believe I actually thought I missed you.
This is beneath even you, Guybrush.
You've got a lot of nerve, coming in here and saying that.
I oughtta just punch you out.
One thing's for sure--you haven't gotten any better at talking to women.
I hope that was a joke.
Same old Guybrush.
Can't you take a hint?
Sorry, Threep.  I don't play those games anymore.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, right.
You know, I have work to do...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Give me a break.
Spare me.
Go tell it to your mother.
Give it up, Brush.
Yeah, but even fish have standards.
Good riddance.
Finally!
Well, thanks for stopping by and ruining my day.
Don't bother my guests on the way out.
Wish I could say it's been nice.
You'll be back...
...unfortunately.
Get lost.
I was just about to say the same thing.
I was wondering when you'd catch a clue.
You're going?
But I was just getting used to the smell.
She's gone.
I guess I really made her mad this time.
I've decided to let you come back to me.
I'm waiting for your apology.
Is it my imagination, or have you gained weight?
I came all this way to see you--at least get me a beer.
Great to see you again.  Is there any food in this dump?
Gosh you're cute when you're pretending to be mad.
Your lonely nights are over, baby.  I have returned.
How's your sister?  The REALLY good-looking one?
You know, I kinda liked your old house better.
So tell me... You and the gardener?  Eh?
Still not afraid to use a lot of perfume, I see.
What I really could use now is a grade-A footrub.
Why don't you slip into something more comfortable?
Still ignoring fashion, eh?  Good for you.
I got a feeling someone needs a big, sloppy kiss.
So, who's the father?
Why don't you just give me that map like a good girl?
Better give me that map.  Treasure huntin's men's work.
Elaine, take me back.  I can't live without you.
Won't you at least give me a second chance?
I realize now what a fool I've been.
My life's been meaningless without you.
If I can't be with you, I don't want to live.
Life without you is an endless nightmare.
You were right.  I was a buffoon.  And a weenie.
Have pity on my poor, broken soul.
Can't you see how my heart has suffered?
Elaine, save me from this whirlpool of misery.
I'd jump out that window to prove my love.
May lightning strike me if I bear false intentions!
I'll win you back, if it's the last thing I do!
My soul is sick, Elaine, and love is the only cure.
If you won't take me back, just kill me now.
Please baby please baby please baby please baby please.
Maybe we should talk about this.
Don't you like my new beard?
Those other women meant nothing to me.
LeChuck's alive, and I need your help to fight him.
I'm not sure, but don't you owe me some money?
Come on.  Let me buy you a grog.
I stopped doing that knuckle-cracking thing.
I should warn you--I cancelled the boat insurance.
Do you have my red sweater?  I can't find it anywhere.
I like what you've done with your hair.
Is that a new blouse?
Real scorcher outside, eh?
Have you been forwarding all my mail?
That's some party downstairs...
You're the Governor of my heart, baby.
Fine.  Be that way.  There are other fish in the sea.
It sure is big.
It's slimy and squishy.
It's slimy and squishy.
It's a whole mess of fish!
I don't think I need any more.
Hey!  Kitchen staff only!

Sorry.
Dang.

Something very strange is going on here...
Do not attempt to adjust your set!
Dad!
Mom!
What are you two doing here?
We came looking for you.
Where have you been?
You came looking for me?
But I thought you abandoned me!
Why would we do that?
We are such loving parents.
Yes, we are.
So what do you two want?
We have some information for you, son.
Really?
Great!
What is it?
Well, we're going to give it to you in the form of a song.

HAR HAR HAR HAR!
LeChuck!
But I killed you!
You didn't kill me, you little moron!
I was already a ghost when you met me!
You just destroyed my spiritual essence...
A favor that I will now return!

It's hundreds and hundreds of maps!
I don't care about the rest.
I don't want them all, and I can't tell which one is Governor Marley's!
There are hundreds of them!
Even if one were a piece of the map to Big Whoop, I would never be able to find it!
That's the bird that stole my map!
No way.  He looks like he bites.

Hello?
Little Guybrush?
Good boy!
Run along home now.
Now that's a good dog.
That doesn't seem to smell interesting to him.
I wouldn't want to do anything that would devalue it.

Deep in the Caribbean, hidden by an endless storm, lies LeChuck's fortress...
So...
...when are we going to resurrect the old bloated fool?
Oops...
I'll ignore that comment just this one time, Largo...
...only because they tell me you've found Guybrush Threekwood.
It's 'Threepwood'...and I've found him on Scabb Island.
Very good.
No one gets the upper hand on LeChuck without getting what he deserves.
I want Guybrush brought to me, and I want him brought alive.
I am entrusting this to you.
Do not fail me.
Never, your voodoo lordship.
Aye...
...Guybrush Threepwood is finished.
I need you to start building me a very special doll.
With pleasure.
Meanwhile, back at the fortress...
Aye...
Largo...
I hear that Guybrush is looking for the lost treasure of Big Whoop.
This be true?
Well... yes sir, but...
What good can a chest full of money do him?
It is not the treasure that is important.
It is what is buried beneath the treasure that concerns me.
He must not find the treasure of Big Whoop.
See to it.
Yes sir.
Deep inside LeChuck's fortress...
Ah...
LeChuck sir...
I regret to report that Guybrush has found one of the map pieces to Big Whoop.
You will regret a lot more if he finds another.
Stop him at any cost...
But remember...
I want him alive.
Yes sir.
Creep.
Once again...
Ah...
LeChuck sir...
I just wanted to report that we have finished building the new torture chamber you requested.
Very good.
Do you have anything else to report?
Ah...
No...
Well...
There is one other small little thing.
I assume this has to do with Guybrush's capture?
Well...
Sort of...
You've allowed him to find the second map piece, haven't you!!
YOU FOOL!
You are to ready your ship and sail after him yerself!
FIND HIM OR DIE!
Deep within LeChuck's fortress bla bla bla bla bla...
Largo!
Er...
You called for me?
Is it true that Guybrush Threepwood has found the third piece of the map to Big Whoop?
Ah...
Yes sir...
I was about...
Why did you not come and tell me yerself?
Well...
I was trying to confirm that he really...
Largo...
You have been my trusted henchman for many years...
But I won't hesitate to drag your entrails from behind my ship...
...if you do not bring me Guybrush before he finds that treasure!
Yawn
LeChuck, sir...
...I've got good news and I've got bad news.
The bad news is that Guybrush has found the last piece of the map.
Ah...
The good news is that I've got a plan that can't fail.
Ah...
You see...
He must take the map to a cartographer to have it deciphered.
I'll head him off before he gets there.
If your plan fails...
It will not, your voodoo lordship.
Hours later...
It's empty.
It's full of voodoo crap.
It's the crate I came here in.
I'm not hauling LeChuck's stuff anywhere.
Especially the way he tips.
I'm not getting back in there!
It's some kind of strange skeleton statue.
It's too heavy.

That is one huge door.
There is no way, not even in an adventure game that I'd be able to get all those locks open.
It's a little bitty door.
Guybrush Threepwood...
You have finally been caught.
I have searched every island...
Sailed every sea...
And now you are mine.
What do you have to say for yourself?
It would've been easier if you'd left directions.
Gee, nice going.
Stop spitting in my face!
If I could just reach my pirate utility belt...
(gulp)
Largo!
Yes sir, LeChuck, sir?
Take Guybrush down to the torture chamber and get the machine set up.
Yes sir.
It's already closed.
I can't find the little doggie door.
I can't find the little doggie door.
Yikes!
Poor Wally.
It's Wally!!!
It's locked up tight.
I'd surely need a key.
Pretty big.
He looks like he's in good health.
I'm sure he'll be able to tell me where the island is.
Hey Guybrush! I'm over here!
Yo Ho!  I'm in the jail Guybrush
Hey Guybrush!  It's me, Wally! The cartographer!
Thank God you've come to rescue me!
Find the key yet?
Oh yeah, the key.
Wally!
Mr. Brush?
Is that you?
I thought you'd never come back.
Well?
Are you alright?
How's it hangin'?
Have you lost weight?  You look good.
Just stopped by to say hi.  Well, see ya.
It was horrible!
They abducted me in my office...
...brought me here in a duffel bag...
...interrogated me...
Then they...
...they...
What? What?
They took away my monocle for awhile.
I see.
You think this is funny?
Yes I have.  Thanks for noticing.
What?
You can't leave me in here!
The map, Wally!  What about the map?
I have something to confess about your monocle.
OK, stand back.  I'm going to bust down the door.
Could you please stop that annoying swinging?
I'm going to go get that key!
I'm going to go have a look around.  Sit tight.
I'm going to go get that key!
I'm going to go have a look around.  Sit tight.
Oh, LeChuck's got it, but who cares?
Who cares?!?
Yes, I memorized the whole thing before he took it.
It's on an island called Dinky, not too far from here.
After you bust me out of here, we could steal a boat and go there!
Sorry.
Dread stole it.
I knew it!
He's always envied my intellectual look.
What, are you nuts?
Go get the key.
He probably keeps it in his office down the hall.
Okeydokey.
I can't tell what this stuff is.
It's too heavy to pick up.
I can't find the lid in the dark.
These are crates, but I don't know what's in them.

Ha!
I'll bet LeChuck is really cheesed-off now!
Yeah.
He should have let me go to the bathroom when I asked!
Yep.
Hey, Wally?
Yeah?
Where are we?
Good question.
I can't see anything in here.
It's too dark to see what I'm doing.
Holy Skunk Sweat!!!
Ouch!
It's burning through the rope at an alarming rate...
Much more of this and he'll be my height.
I can't really pull that out right now...
I can't do that from my current position.
I can't reach him from here.
I can't reach that from here.
I can't reach the punching bag from here.

Hahahaha...
You be in a heap of trouble Guybrush Threepwood.
Now that you are mine, you will pay for what you did to me.
Hey...
What's a little root beer between friends...
Silence!
There is only one thing more painful...
...than being resurrected from the dead and...
...crammed into a rotting body.
Do you know what that is?
Hmmm...
It is what is about to happen to you!
Can't we talk this thing out?
You see that candle over there?
When it burns through that rope...
...the bag will fall on the bellows.
When it is compressed, it will shoot a single lead bullet...
...which will ricochet off that pan...
...then off the shield behind me...
bounce off that other shield...
...finally striking the green balloon.
When it pops, it will cause that lever to fall...
...releasing that ratchet on the chain wheel...
...and sending you down into the pit of acid.
Geee...I...
Do you know what happens next?
Ummmm...well...
I will take your bones...
...still alive and in great pain...
...and make them into a chair.
I will call it my screaming chair.
Every morning I will sit in it and listen to you scream.
Any questions?
Yeah.  Can I go to the bathroom?
Ha ha ha!
This will be even more torturous than I had hoped!
Any other questions?
What does the candle do?
What happens when the bag falls on the bellows?
How's the lead bullet going to get to the balloon?
Where do babies come from?
Isn't it dangerous to leave a pit of acid uncovered?
Gee, I had a million questions a second ago...
Who won the world series in '56?
Have you ever tried conditioner on that beard?
Where's the bathroom?
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck, if a...
If this is 4 and this is 2, what's this?
What is the secret of Monkey Island?
Why do adventure games cost so much?
Why didn't you just shoot me when I came in?

It will ricochet off a bunch of stuff.
Safety is not my concern in this situation.

No.

Relight the candle!
GUYBRUSH HAS ESCAPED!
Find them!
If I spit that way, I might hit myself...
Hey!
Watch it with the spit!
My mouth is all dried-up.
Hey!
Watch it with the spit!
Oops...
AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!
So, Wally...
Yeah?
Ah, nothing.
I love you, man.
Could you please scratch my nose?
Any bright ideas?
I've got a bad feeling about this...
Let's keep our heads, shall we?
Yeah, right after you kiss my butt.
Well...
...I have one, but it's kind of embarrassing...
Wally!  This is a matter of life and death!
Oh...
OK, I'll do it.
But you have to close your eyes.
What?!
Close your eyes, unless you want to become undead furniture.
Well...
...actually, I was hoping you'd think of something.
Oh.
Bad feeling!?!
LeChuck's got you hanging in chains over a pit of acid and all you've got is a bad feeling?!?
Gosh.  I feel even worse when you yell at me.
Just leave me alone.
Horse hockey.
You honestly expect me to believe you were disintegrated in acid.
Sure, well I--
And yet here you are telling me all about it, looking very integrated indeed.
Yes, well, that is...
...ah...
...OK, so I embellished it a little for dramatic effect.
Sue me.
You want to try telling me what REALLY happened?
OK.
As I was saying, we were hanging over the pit of acid.
Death was so close I could smell his hairy armpits...
There wasn't anything down there.
The galleon is here!
Well, here we are.
What now?
What did you do, order this ship out of the back of a comic book?
This ship is so small, the rats are leaving it humpbacked.
Whose bathtub did the ship come from?
I've seen bigger ships in bottles.
I've seen COFFEE CUPS bigger than this ship.
I'll dive in and look for the sunken galleon.
I'll dive in again.
Let's head back to Booty Island.
I'm sure it's near here, can we try another spot?
Very funny.
The guy who writes your lines is as funny as your tailor.
Did you think that up all by yourself?
Ha ha.
Can we get on with it?
OK.
Are you sure you can swim?
Hey, I can hold my breath for ten minutes!
Well...
...I feel kind of sorry for you, so OK.
Just point it out.

They say `anchovies` on the top.
Ick, no, they smell like anchovies.
Ick, no, they smell like anchovies.
'Welcome to Dinky Island'
'home of the treasure of Big Whoop.'
Hi, Herman.
Herman Toothrot!  What are you doing here?
Word up, Herman.
Oh, hi.
I've been waiting for you.
What do you mean you've been waiting for me?
What are you doing here?
I think I have an answer to the philosophical puzzle you posed for me.
Could you teach me some philosophy?
I'm looking for a treasure.  Have you seen any?
I think I have better things to do than talk to you.
Our meeting comes at this, the final moment of my existence so far.
All else has been in anticipation of this event.
I think you will find that the concept of 'better things' is the frailest of illusions.
Do you always say things like that?
Do you mean to tell me that your WHOLE LIFE has been merely a prelude to meeting me here today?
What happens now that I'm here?
You're weirding me out, I gotta go.
Nothing I say is ever the same, yet it is all said the same way.
Yours too.
But see, already the moment passes.
Now our meeting is nothing more than another note in the grand overture to the next passage.
The moment has passed, and we face the future.
As you wish.
You will return.
There are many treasures here, found and unfound.
The beauty of the ocean, for example.
I was thinking more along the lines of monetary gain.
Actually, I'm looking for the treasure of Big Whoop.
Yes, that's quite true.
Or the treasure of the past, seen in the rings of trees or the half-remembered cacklings of a parrot...
...the treasure of the future, waiting in the seeds of mangoes and the eggs of the platypus...
...dreams that bring us messages from afar which we are too simple to understand, and stars that do the same...
...and may not riches be found in the words of one who has explored the veiled inner worlds of the self?
Speaking of which, I am taking on students for a limited time.
Money is seldom a treasure, my friend.
Big Whoop?
I'm afraid I'm not familiar with that one.
...and of course there's the treasure of patience...
I'm teaching philosophy here.
Right here, on the beach?
What sort of philosophy are you teaching?
How many students have you got?
That's nice, but I think I'd best be off now.
Sure beats a Tibetan mountaintop.
I can go surfing when things are slow.
Neo-existentialist Cartesian Zen Taoism.
It's all the rage at cocktail parties this year.
Well...
...none, at the moment.
But as soon as word gets out that a guru such as myself is teaching in a beautiful locale like this...
...I'll have to beat them off with a stick.
Just let me know if you want to learn a little philosophy.
OK, here's a Zen koan for you.
A what?
A philosophical puzzle.
If a tree falls in the forest, and no one is around to hear it...
...what color is the tree?
Alright, what is it?
Brown?
Blue?
Forest Green?
Red?
Cyan?
Lavender?
Magenta?
Puce?
Aquamarine?
Taupe?
Burnt Sienna?
Raw Umber?

Hot Pink?
Oatmeal Heather?
All colors?
I give up.
Nope.
No.
Nah.
Not even close.
Not exactly.
Think about it some more, and come back when you have an answer.
Exactly!
Now, what has this experience taught you?
That philosophy isn't worth my time.
I'm very impressed, it takes most people years to reach this point.
You have learned all that you can from me.
Go forth into the world with confidence.
I won't even charge you a buck.
That seems to have gotten most of the salt out of it.
Pretty Polly.
OK, let's go over it one more time.
Head due east from the pond to the dinosaur.
Head north from the dinosaur to the pile of rocks.
Head due east from the rocks to the X.
Head due east from the pond to the dinosaur.
Head north from the dinosaur to the pile of rocks.
Head due east from the rocks to the X.
There are some crackers in here.
Hey, there's a cracker in here.
There, I think that'll hold.
Polly wants a cracker.
SQUAWK
BRAAAK
Gee, Captain Marley, where should we bury the treasure?
OK, let's go over it again so no one forgets where we buried the treasure.
No, no, no, that's not right.
Oh, the heck with it.
Let's make a map, and tear it into four pieces.
I want my granddaughter to marry a REAL man, a CAPTAIN.
Not a washout like you.
Head due east from the pond to the dinosaur.
Head north from the dinosaur to the pile of rocks.
Head due east from the rocks to the X.
Great Scott!
That came from the direction of Dinky Island!
That idiot must be messing with my grandfather's treasure!
I'd better get over there.
I've hit cement!
It's a good shovel, but I can't dig through cement with it.
There's a layer of cement at the bottom.
It looks like there's some sort of cavern down there.
That's the second biggest X I've ever seen.
I might not be able to get out!
Oh, you meant THIS treasure.
Why didn't you say so?
You could have come by the shortcut, like I do.
Shortcut?
Shaky.
I'm not sure that's a good idea.
Looks as shaky as the one I'm standing on.
I might knock it off.
That must be the treasure of Big Whoop!
They look sturdy, apart from being all bent up.
I can't get up there.
...and you showed up about three days later.
Will you help me now?
Anything to shut you up.
That has to have been the longest story I've ever heard.
Oh, dear.
Well, well, well.
Guybrush Threepwood.
You do turn up in the strangest places.
Err...
Hi, Elaine.
Do you think you could help me out?
How did you get into this mess?
It's kind of a long story.
That's OK, I've got time.
*sigh*
Well, it all started on Scabb Island.
Some of my admiring fans had pressured me into telling my LeChuck evaporating story once again...
It looks very big and heavy.
It's nailed shut.
I think it's a bit heavy for me.
`900 pounds`
It's definitely part of LeChuck's beard.
It's already closed.
It's already open.
The door's closed.
Ow!
Ouch!
Hey!
OW!!
Ow!
Ouch!
Hey!
OW!!
The street is closed off.
Ooooh!  A circus.
I love a circus!
`Employees Only`
The warning tape says closed for construction.
That would be unlawful.
That would be unlawful.
That would be unlawful.
That would be unlawful.
This is hauntingly familiar...
They're full of root beer.
What, all of them?

What, all of them?
There's loads of root beer in here.
It's full of root beer.
I wouldn't want to open them ALL.
One bottle of root beer should be sufficient.
I don't want a whole box.

They're little generic voodoo Kewpie dolls.
It's full of dolls.
I'll just take one.
I don't want any more voodoo dolls.
I don't want to carry around a whole box of dolls.
They're full of root beer.
What, all of them?
What, all of them?
They're full of root beer.
What, all of them?
What, all of them?
It's already closed.
Whatever for?
It's an attractive green color.
It's empty.
It's a box of balloons.
It's already open.
Hey, there's only one balloon in here.
It's empty.
I don't want to carry a whole box.
I love root beer.
I'd get everything all sticky.
It's positively PULSING with voodoo energy!
It's just a cheap little doll with no voodoo powers at all.
It's an attractive green color.
Now you're in for it...
you bilious bag of barnacle bait!
Well...
I'd rather be a pirate on Scabb...
Than a scab on a pirate.
I'm Bobbin Threadbare...
Are you my mother?
StumpMaster brand Stump Balm...
Guaranteed to prevent stump chafing for the active pirate.
Oh, there's a monkey in my pocket,
And he's stealing all my change,
His stare is blank and glassy, I suspect that he's deranged...
Now you're in for it...

What a cheap looking costume.
I can't reach that high.
I can't reach that high.
I can't reach that high.
I can't reach that high.
It brings back painful memories.
That won't do much.
That won't do much.
It's out of order.
It looks like it's been here a long time.
It's too heavy for me to lift.
It's already filled.
It's already filled.
It's already filled.
It's already closed.
It's probably full of tools and useful stuff.
It's stuck.
It's stuck.
It's already closed.
It's probably got all kinds of money and valuables in it.
It's jammed.
It's empty.
It's already open.
There's nothing to pick up.
It's already closed.
I bet it has all sorts of powerful voodoo supplies inside.
It's already closed.
It's most likely full of technological wonders.
It's already closed.
It's probably empty.
Must be a pretty small railroad.
I think it's more of those anchovies.
It's nailed shut.
It's missing the head.
I can't reach that high.
I can't reach that high.
I can't reach that high.
I can't reach that high.
It's a little lever.
A veritable fortune.
Wheee!
Wheee!
I'd really rather not.
Wow, a '43 steelie!
Whoa, a wheat-back!
It's a buffalo head!
Alright, a double eagle!
Hey, a Susan B. Anthony!
Cool, an arcade token!
What a find!
Yeow!
Boy, that look comfy!
This is no time for playing doctor.
It has that austere but functional look.
I'd love to, but I'm kind of pressed for time.
It's my mom.
Dad looks a bit looser...
I've disturbed them enough.
That wouldn't be polite.
That wouldn't be polite.
Hi, mom.
That wouldn't be polite.
It's my dad.
Hmm...
This looks loose.
I've disturbed them enough.
That wouldn't be polite.
That wouldn't be polite.
Hi, dad.
That wouldn't be polite.
Alas, poor Dad.
That wouldn't be polite.
That wouldn't be polite.
Hi, dad.
It's already closed.
There's a syringe in here.
It's empty.
It's just an ordinary drawer.
It's already open.
There's a syringe in here.
Where am I going to put a drawer?
Yikes!
I don't like loud noises.
That wouldn't do much.
I don't like loud noises.
That wouldn't do much.
I don't like loud noises.
That wouldn't do much.
That wouldn't do anything.
I'd better not.
It's already closed.
There's stuff in here.
It's empty.
Nice trash can.
It's already open.
There's stuff in it.
It's empty.
I don't want a trash can.
It's a pair of surgical gloves.
It's a surgical glove.
This is no time to be playing doctor.
It's a surgical glove.
This is no time to be playing doctor.
Holy cow, these are my PARENTS!!
It's a pair of surgical gloves.
I don't think LeChuck's close enough for it to do anything.
That's pretty good, Guybrush...
...but not good enough to stop ME!
Hold on.
Can't we talk this over?
I know you're upset.
Wait a second.
Let's not be hasty.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let me explain.
Let's bury the hatchet.
Let bygones be bygones.
Err...
Ah...
Uh...
Um...
Let's discuss this like rational adults.
There's no need for violence.
Eh?
Oh, it's you.
What, THAT again?
Ooh, look at me quakin' in me booties.
I laugh at you and your puny voodoo tinkerings.
Hah!
Take THIS, LeChuck!
Take THAT, LeChuck!
You know, this doll reminds me of the Stretchy Muscleman I had as a kid.
I wonder what would happen if I tore the leg off this thing?
Come on!
You don't scare me!
You think you're so big?
Stab the doll again!
It doesn't hurt!
I can take it!
I'm not afraid of your doll!
What are you gonna do now?
I'm gonna kick your butt, what do you think about that?
I'm much too powerful for you and your puny doll!
You'll have to do better than that!
Is that the best you can do?
You always were a wimp.
Ha!
...argh...
Guybrush...
'--ghack--
What?
Come over here.
No way, I'm not that stupid.
But I want you to--
'--gag--
'--take my mask off...
...choke...
...see the TRUE face of your brother...
Forget it, I'm not coming over there.
No chance, you'll just rip my lungs out when I get close.
Leg or no leg, I trust you about as far as I can throw Manhattan.
Oh, all right, I'm coming over.
But you've got to see--
'--hack--
'--my TRUE face!
'--gurgle--
No, no, I promise!
Please, come take off the--
'--argh--
'--the mask!
I tell you I'm--
'--ack--
'--dying here!
Take the mask off!
Gently now, remove my--
'--hack--
'--mask.
My god, you're...
...my creepy brother Chuckie.
What, did you think I was kidding before?
Why have you been chasing me all over the place?
When our mother told you to hunt me down, did she actually mention KILLING me, or was that your idea?
How come you hate me as much as you obviously do?
Do you really think a truck is more important than your own BROTHER?
Our mother told me to hunt you down.
Get outta town!
Well, you remember the time you broke my Junior Ultra Soldier Commando Assault Vehicle?
No.
It wasn't a truck, it was a Junior Ultra Soldier Commando Assault Vehicle.
Look, Guybrush, could you help me out?
Stick the leg back on the doll, OK?
Will you promise to stop picking on me?
Will you promise not to hold me down and spit on me anymore?
Will you promise to stop locking me in your footlocker?
All right, all right, I promise!
Anything, just put my leg back on!
Hey, you kids!
You're not supposed to be in here!
Ah, so there you are!
What's going on?
Who are you people?
What IS this place?
We're scolding you for running off.
Your mother and I were very concerned.
Just the same old family you've always had.
Your mother and I were very concerned.
Well, it's not the Screaming Weenie Hut where we told you to meet us.
Thank you for hunting down your brother like we asked, Chuckie dear.
You boys didn't get in any trouble, now, did you?
No, sir.
Chuckie tried to kill me!
I stole a bunch of stuff and caused two huge explosions.
No, sir.
         No, sir.
Good.
I wish you wouldn't run off like that, young man.
We were worried sick.
You don't know what kinds of murderers and ne'er do wells might be hanging around a place like this.
Yes, mom.
OK, mom.
I'm Guybrush Threepwood, a mighty pirate.  I don't have to worry about stuff like that.
This is weird.  What's going on here?
Of course, dear.
But please be careful.
Well, come on then, let's go ride the Madly Rotating Buccaneer.
Yeah!
Take this, BROTHER.
Hey, nothing's happening!
Root beer only works on ghosts, Guybrush.
Having been resurrected, I'm not a ghost anymore.
Allow me to demonstrate.
Here, try this.
Now, isn't that better?
Aha!
Caught you!
Now you're gonna get it!
Hey, Guybrush!
It's voodoo time!
Boo!
Eek!
Hello, Guybrush.
Hello, LeChuck.
Goodbye, LeChuck.
Would you mind not spitting so much when you talk?
You won't escape me this time!
Yeah?  Just watch me!
I escaped from you before, I can easily do it again.
Oh?  Why do you say that?
You're right, I give up.
Not so fast!
That's just as well.
Even if you were to escape, I would always be able to find you again.
We are bound to one another.
Like soup and salad?
Like life and limb?
Like dreadlocks?
Not really.
More like...
How appropriate.
But I meant more like...
Yes, rather like that.
Or like...
...brothers!
Huh?
I--
--am your brother!
No!
No, that's not true!
That's impossible!
Search your feelings, you KNOW it to be true!
Noooooooo!!!!
...and I brought a little surprise for you!
I think you being my brother is enough of a surprise for one day.
Really?  A treat?
Am I going to enjoy this?
I don't suppose it's a LucasArts0x99 game...
Perhaps, but humor me.
A treat for ME, a surprise for YOU.
No, but I will.
No...
A dolly?  The surprise is a dolly?
What's with the big, sharp, deadly looking pin?
Is this going to be anything like `pin the tail on the donkey`?
Say, that wouldn't happen to be a voodoo doll, would it?
The surprise is a VOODOO dolly...
It's an accessory for this voodoo doll...
Something like that.
This is a voodoo doll...
Why yes, as a matter of fact it IS a voodoo doll...
...which I'll be using to torture you...
...and then send you screaming to another dimension, one of infinite pain!
Observe...
I'll do anything, just please don't do that again!
Are you quite finished?
Mama!
OK, how about this:
No, I want to do this:
Heh heh heh.
That was exhilarating!
Let's have some more fun, shall we?
Please!
No more!
OK, time to send you screaming to a dimension of infinite pain!
Aaaiiiiieeee!!!!
At last, I'm rid of that pesky little wimp Guybrush!
WHUMP!
Hey, I'm alive!
Eh?
I thought I was a goner!
Whoops...
Strange...
There must be something wrong with my voodoo doll.
It was supposed to send you to another dimension, not the next room.
Shoddy materials, I'll bet.
Well, I guess I'll just try it again.
Uh, no, that's OK, I--
I can't get up there.
I can't get up there.
I can't get up there.
I can't get up there.
I've been in the dark enough for one day.
I've been in the dark enough for one day.
I've been in the dark enough for one day.
I should push the little button.
I should push the little button.
I should push the little button.
I should push the little button.
Looks like the elevator is on this floor.
`Service elevator`
`1000 pound limit`
Boy, what a gyp!
What do I want with a bunch of bits of broken treasure chest?
It says `E` on it.
It says `Elevator this way.`
It says `First aid this way.`
Nice echo.
I can't see a thing.
I think that might be a dangerous way to open it, after all it DOES say `TNT` on the side.
It's already open.
It's tied shut with rope.
It's nailed shut.
It's full of dynamite.
It's empty.
It's nailed shut.
I did that already.
It's tied shut with rope.
I did that already.
Hey, dynamite, just like it says on the side!
The writing on it says `ages 3 and up.`
I think a shovel should be sufficient for this soft ground.
I wouldn't be able to light it again, I'm out of matches.
I don't want to blow that up.
I don't want to blow that up.
That's not such a great idea.
I don't think it will do much good unless I light it first.
Looks strong.
I could probably get the rope off with my hands.
I don't think it will catch on there.
I slashed it up pretty well.
There's something lumpy in it.
It's empty already.
It doesn't seem interested.
OK, it's closed.
It's empty.
It used to be full of instant low-sodium cracker mix, but now it's empty.
It's instant low-sodium cracker mix, just add water.
OK, it's open.
I think that's a bit too much water.
It's a low-sodium cracker.
It's a low-sodium cracker.
It doesn't seem interested.
It's a disgusting bog.
It looks a bit thick for swimming.
Yech, I don't want any of THIS revolting sludge.

Lucasfilm Games Hint Line.
Chester speaking.
I'm lost in the Dinky Island jungle in Monkey II.
When is SWOTL going to ship?
Who thought up that dumb stump joke?
Where do babies come from?
Why do adventure games cost so much?
What IS the secret of Monkey Island?
How much money have I spent talking to you?
Thank you, you've been very helpful.  Good-bye.
Look, there are only two ways out of the room you're in.
Figure it out, knucklehead.
I told you, just walk off the edge of the screen.
How hard could that be?
It's been out for some time now.
Where have you been, playing some frustrating graphic adventure?
I'm tired of hearing about that damn stump.
Do you have any idea how many calls I get a DAY about that?
Don't ask me about it again.
Yeah, sure.
What are you, a pervert?
What's wrong with you?
Hey, I just work here.
I'm fed up with stupid questions like that.
It's a surprise, OK?
Seventy-five cents a minute.
You can ask your computer to work out the math for you.
Head north from the dinosaur to the pile of rocks.
Head due east from the rocks to the X.
I can't reach it.
Pretty Polly.
Head due east from the pond to the dinosaur.
Head north from the dinosaur to the pile of rocks.
Head due east from the rocks to the X.
I'll just take this rope off of it...
Hey, it's nailed shut!
It's lit now.
The fuse is burning down.
It's not burning very fast, but it's making definite progress.
More than half the fuse is gone already.
I think I'd better use this soon.
There's only about an inch of fuse left.
There's only about a half-inch of fuse left.
There's only about a quarter-inch of fuse left.
I'm getting a bit worried about carrying this around.
Looks like about an eighth of an inch of fuse left.
There couldn't be more than a sixteenth of an inch of fuse now.
I think I'd better use this REALLY soon.
There's a tiny amount of fuse left.
I can't really even see the fuse anymore.
I don't know how much time is left before this blows up, but I'll bet it's not long.
Boy, I must be a real idiot, carrying around a bunch of lit dynamite for so long.
Any minute now...
I think it's about to explode.
I bet if I even shake this too hard it will go off!
Hey!
You guys get out of here!
Deep in the Caribbean \n Scabb Island
I wonder what I'm doing standing next to this hole?
I wonder what's keeping Guybrush?
I hope LeChuck hasn't cast some horrible SPELL over him or anything.
Ron: My name's Ron Gilbert and I did pretty much everything on this game. I did all the art, the music, programming and the writing.
Tim: So typical.0x0ADave: I'm Dave Grossman; I helped Ron do everything on this game.
Dave: I helped to design puzzles and wrote lots of dialogue and programmed things and made little people walk around and created scenes.
Tim: My name's Tim Schafer, I helped get coffee for these guys. And then at night, I redid everything that they did.
And I was an assistant designer-programmer, that's the official title.0x0ARon: That was part of the official title.
Tim: Yeah. So we helped with puzzles and then wrote dialogue and then programmed.0x0AWow, we used to program.
Ron: Mm hmm. I still program too.0x0ATim: What's happening?
Dave: What was that sound?0x0ATim: Oh my god the game's starting! What an awesome game!
Tim: Oh, we're going into Woodtick. Don't go on that bridge, there's a... don't!
Dave: I always liked this bit because the player always feels like they've done something wrong.
Ron: Right, without knowing it.0x0ADave: Yeah. People would actually go back and try and play this again, to try
and not get caught by him on the bridge.0x0ARon: Yeah, Largo LaGrande is named after where I grew up.
Tim: Largo? Key Largo?0x0ARon: Nah, I grew up in Le Grande Oregon, so that's where I, or we, got his name.
Dave: Where did the Largo come from?0x0ARon: I don't know. That's how they used to call him back there.
Dave: They used to call him Largo?0x0ATim: That was his nickname, "Hey Largo."
Ron: Largo from Le Grande.0x0ATim: Is that Bogart, Key Largo?
Ron: I always liked how he started out with a whole bunch of money so you kinda thought he had a bunch of stuff, and then it all like, completely goes away
at the very beginning of the game.0x0ATim: Yeah, that fit in with our running theme of mean, cruel things that we enjoyed.
Give a player a bunch of money, and then take it away from them.0x0ARon: And then just take it all away from them immediately, yup.
Tim: I just wanna say how good looking Guybrush's hair is looking, in this game.0x0AHe has a new stylist in this game. But his eyes are in the... ok sorry.
Dave: Wasn't the money thing inspired by just how much time you spent in the first game having to get money, like it was a really big thing.
Like, "Oh, you didn't have any money and you had to go to the circus and get a job and all that". It's like, this time; let's start them off with TONS of money.
Ron: More money than I know what to do. And then we're gonna take it all away.
Tim: OK, here is the big premier of iMUSE. Right? 0x0ARon: Yes.
Tim: This is the biggest, and I think the biggest ever, most complicated piece of iMUSE music that was ever made.
Ron: We had like, two, like, full time programmers who were doing nothing but programming the iMUSE transitions.
Tim: Cause like, it's a main theme outside and then every time you go into one of these inner locations, or inside the house, it would...
...enable or disable instruments and it would change the theme a little bit.0x0ARon: Right. Right. Yeah I know, iMUSE was like, absolutely amazing.
Tim: But, they put a lot of work into it and they decided never to do it again. They were like, no one noticed! I noticed.
Ron: I did!
Tim: I think, this may be controversial too, but I think that the Special Edition for...
...Monkey 2 is an improvement, like, as an old... Like, playing... I'm very nostalgic when I play the Special Edition for Monkey 1.
I was kinda like, the old art is so charming, I always play it in the old art. The new art was really pretty but I was really drawn... But, Monkey 2...
...I'm not saying that Monkey 2 looked bad, but we were just starting to use the scanner and so we hadn't cleaned up much stuff.
So it's actually really nice to see it switch into that cleaned up view, because I 0x0Athink, you know, in later games we would take all those stray pixels out and...
Ron: Just smooth it all out.0x0ATim:...smooth it all out, yeah.
Ron: I think some of that's an artifact of the markers, because you know, Peter Chan did everything with those markers.
Ron: It's all done with the markers, think that's a little of an artifact of that.0x0ATim: That's my rounded way, roundabout compliment of the Monkey 2 Special Edition.
Tim: Largo reminds me of someone from like, old, like, Bowery Boys movies. You know what I mean? Bowery Boys.
Tim: Or Squiggy, from Laverne and Shirley. Oh my god! I just realized that's where I stole the intro to Full Throttle, like I pull... that's embarrassing...
...where he pulls his nose down to the bar, it's totally, ugh... how embarrassing... 0x0AI totally stole that whole quohog thing from Monkey 2.
Ron: Just also a lot of foreshadowing with the spitting, and the spitting contest... and all of those things in there.
Tim: Where's the spittoon? Oh no, there's spit over there on the left hand side.0x0ADave: Oh yeah.
Tim: Did we do a close up of the spit flying, or did we cut that?0x0ARon: No that was there.
Tim: That was there?0x0ARon: Oh, you weren't paying attention.
Tim: I was watching you guys, I was mesmerized.0x0ADave: One of the greatest things about this game was the shirt that we did with...
...the three dimensional puffy spit0x0ARon: Oh and that monkeys down the sleeve?
Tim: It's a great day for spitting. 0x0ADave: That was the Monkey 1 shirt.
Ron: Was that the Monkey 1 shirt?0x0ATim: Monkey 1 was a tasteful shirt that you could wear outside. The Monkey 2 shirt...
Ron: No that was...0x0ATim: ...you would just fold it up and put it away in a box  because it was so gross...
...and there were gobs of spit all over it.0x0ARon: There were the puffy monkeys down the sleeve, was that Monkey 1?
Dave: That was Monkey 1, yeah, the long sleeve one. 0x0ATim: Monkey 2 we did and we didn't get approval for it, and people at management...
...were mad afterwards. They were like, that is the grossest shirt ever, I can't believe you made that.
Tim: I love Wally the cartographer.
Dave: Wally has just taken so much abuse over the course of this series, it just seems to me.
Ron: Well you know, we cut that stuff at the end of the game with, you know, him on the raft and all that.
Tim: That's right, we cut the whole raft thing.0x0ARon: I get a lot of email from people wanting to know what we were going to do..
...with Wally and that whole cut section.0x0ATim: Could you show what happens to him now?
Tim: Because when you blow up out of the, you know, the what you might call it, you blow up out of the, and then you used to land in a raft.
Ron: Mm hmm.0x0ATim: I guess we'll find out.
Ron: I don't remember.0x0ATim: That's a good voice for him. Woah, could you guys hear my ... internal organs?
Ron: See now we steal his, err, we steal his monocle.0x0ATim: We steal his monocle, and it's super sad, yeah!...
...we totally make him unable to do his job but because we needed the lens for our little...
Ron:  Exactly.0x0ADave: Yup. Gonna ruin everyone in this town before we're done.
Tim: Oh god I forgot about the graveyard! 0x0ARon: This is like the greatest scene ever.
Tim: Why are the bats making different sounds here? 0x0ADave: Okay, so why...
Tim: This is another thing we fought over. I thought the pants thing...I didn't think that was funny.
Ron: I think the pants thing was hilarious.0x0ATim: And he thought it was the best thing in the whole game.
Ron: I did. I did. And I still do. I still do. I actually use this as an example sometimes when I'm talking to people.
Tim: You used to think it was funny and now realize it's not funny? 0x0ARon: No, it's like the pinnacle of humor. It's an un-top-able moment.
Tim: But what, did he pull his belt off in order to dig... what, why did, why is...Why does that happen, Ron? Now, tell us!
Ron: Because...0x0ADave: It's because the game requires different levels of humor. You've got your...
...sophisticated, wry humor...0x0ATim: But why do his pants fall down? Did he take, did he use his belt to dig?
Ron: You see, the problem is you're trying to justify it too much. It's just funny, just roll with it.
Dave: It's fantasy. About pants falling down.0x0ARon: It's just a stupid computer game, Tim.
Tim: See that's the, see, I think that could have been a really deep moment, his pants fell for a reason. For example he was digging up...
Dave: Gravity?0x0ATim: Oh, you win. It's hilarious. But I never liked any of those... I was against the...
...insult sword fighting, remember? I was, like, people are gonna be really mad.
Ron: You were?0x0ATim: Well, for the beginning of the meeting, you were, like, how about, I think it's
...action oriented if we actually put swordfighting in there, because it was going to be like, karataka, kartika, karateka. And umm, I think it's too...
...too action-oriented, I think people would enjoy it more if it was just insults. Which I realized now is a great idea. At that time, I thought we were gonna get angry...
...letters from people who want to use their sword. They, you know... But err, I saw the... I saw the light eventually.
Ron: Well that came from those, all those time we spent watching those movies, in the media room at the main house, was the way the pirates, you know, verbally...
...jousted with each other.0x0ATim: Mm hmm.
Dave: Yeah I remember you saying, it was just what they said that it was important and that the sword fighting always seemed like a kind of background activity.
Tim: Captain Dread! 0x0ADave: It's a great name!
Ron: I never liked his name.0x0ATim: Captain Dread? That's a great name!
Tim: It's both scary pirate name, and dreadlocks!0x0ARon: You're wrong.
Tim: Maybe you don't realize this but those big chunks of 0x0Ahair are called dreadlocks.
Ron: I think it was because the pun was too obvious. 0x0ATim: Oh, there is something too obvious and not subtle enough in Monkey Island...
...for you, pants-dropper.0x0ARon: Right. Well it's because you're missing all the symbolism of the pants dropping.
Tim: The thing I didn't like was that you never see his face except for the very beginning. His head is turned the whole time round.
Tim: This is so disconcerting to see just the back of his head. He could just have his head, he could have his head just tilted a little bit like that.
Tim: Oh that voodoo guy, I forgot about him. Oh geez. Oh, LeChuck's asymmetrical walking was the hardest thing to get right of any walk cycle, I think still to this...
...day that was ever done. 0x0ARon: Because he couldn't be flipped?
Tim: He couldn't be flipped, and he moved an uneven number of pixels every frame.0x0ADave: I like how much he spits when he talks too. More foreshadowing I guess.
Tim: I forgot that voodoo character. What does he do, that voodoo guy?0x0ADave: I don't know, I can't remember.
Ron: I actually don't remember him.0x0ATim: Dude I don't remember that guy at all! Does he? Let's cut him in the Special...
...Edition, because he's...he's got a good voice though.0x0ADave: Yeah.
Tim: Oh here comes this exciting sailing scene. Oh this was for the ship combat I worked so hard on!
Ron: No, that was on Monkey 1. That was on Monkey 1.0x0ATim: It was not in Monkey 1.
Dave: That's right.0x0ATim: It was in the cutting room floor of Monkey 1, cause it was too good for that...
...game. Okay "Jolly Rasta" that's not a good name. "Dread" is a good name but "Jolly Rasta" isn't.
Ron: Jolly Rasta is a bad name. 0x0ATim: It sounds like pasta.
Ron: It's a horrible name. 0x0ADave: Should have been the "Jolly Pasta"?
Tim: Yeah it should have been the "Jolly Pasta", should have been 0x0Athe "Elbow Macaroni."
Dave: The thing I remember about Governor Phatt was just that, he was way bigger on screen than characters that we generally did.
Tim: He was like a small planet. 0x0ADave: He didn't move around much, he was like yeah, just this enormous, guy.
Ron: You could have lived inside him. 0x0ATim: We only animated his, like, mouth or something.
Dave: Yeah. Which is kinda whole jiggle-y thing. 0x0ARon: One thing that I liked, I always liked about Monkey Island 1 and 2...
...was how you're kinda playing this game and almost when you think the game's over, it's like then kinda the real game starts.
So it's like you're spending all this time on Scabb Island or on Melee Island and you think you're kinda completing the main objective of the...
...game and then the whole game kinda opens up after that. I always liked that.0x0ATim: And all of the err, RTS elements come in to it at that point.
Dave: This game's huge! 0x0ARon: Yeah, and the first person shooter stuff, I don't know if people discovered that.
Tim: I always loved this poster, I loved that, I always liked to do that I've always wanted to do that in other games...
Like, every game should have a poster that lists everything you've done.0x0ARon: Oh, All the bad things?
Tim: All the bad things you've done...0x0ARon: Stealing the monocle.
Tim: In the voice of the character, in the voice of the, see we're obviously feeling bad about Guybrush's crimes, because we listed them here on this poster.
Dave: We did that in, in Tales, in the 4th episode which is the Trial and Execution of Guybrush Threepwood.
Tim: I've heard that's the...0x0ADave: You get...
Tim: the best one ... 0x0ADave: Maybe the best one.
Dave: Err, but the funniest bit is you get put on trial and it lists out all of the stuff you did in the 1st episodes.
Dave: And that's all of the things you're under arrest for then.
Ron: So this is also the big Pirates of the Caribbean ride rip-off moment, too.
Dave: Yeah. Yeah we can't really complain about the movie ripping off the game...0x0ATim: Stealing this.
Ron: They were just giving us back for this, that's all there really was. 0x0ATim: Yeah.
Tim: And the dog's named Walt.0x0ADave: Is he?
Dave: That Steve Purcell's dog?0x0ARon: Why was our dog named Walt?
Tim: Is that not for Walt Disney? No. 0x0ADave: Steve Purcell's dog was called Walt. I think that was...
Tim: Well that was probably named after Walt Disney. 0x0ADave: That is possible. Walt was a, I remember, kind of a mean old dog who...
...bit me once. 0x0ATim: Dude, Walt's dead, don't make fun of Walt.
Ron: I like that the dog was named after Walt Disney, let's just go with that. 0x0ATim: Yeah, it's a sweeter story.
Ron: It's always really hard, you know, to design these 0x0Apuzzle things where he's confined in one room.
Because it's like everything on him, and you have to figure out how to do it, and all of the solutions or...
Tim: And if it's too hard, then it's just you're stuck in a tiny tiny room.0x0ARon: You're stuck, yeah. But if it's too easy, it's a gimme puzzle and it's just...
...not interesting.0x0ADave: Just, there is something comforting about the fact that, you know, you...
...can't go anywhere so you know all your assets are right there. There is some way out, like you, it's never like...
Tim: Unless you were playing a Sierra game, then you could be a...0x0ADave:...game oh, I didn't pick something up three rooms away. I've gotta go get there.
Tim: Pffft, Sierra...0x0ARon: Right, without the pencil.
Tim: What's this room? I don't remember this room! Did they add this for the Special Edition?
Dave: Is this the game where we put in the "If this is three, then what's this?" puzzle?
Ron: Yes.0x0ADave: That was a mean, mean puzzle.
Tim: I have an apology for that, that came from my family. 0x0ADave: Yeah?
Tim: That was a trick, a game, my brother played with me. If this is two, what's this? If this is four, what's this?
Ron: I remember that we went round and round trying to find some clever 0x0Athing to do that. I think that door existed for quite a while without any real...
...puzzle there. 0x0ADave: There was like one of those "Insert Puzzle here" signs.
Ron: Yeah, right. 0x0ADave: It's nice that we could actually do that on these games. Like, that's hard...
...to do now, to design a game and say, "Well okay, here's a puzzle, we're just 0x0Agonna put something in later and we'll think of it, you know, two months from...
...now while we're building the game we'll write some different dialogue for it." 0x0ARon: Dialogue recording, voice recording, really, I think, killed all that...
...spontaneity that we had in Monkey 1 and Monkey 2.0x0ADave: You just have to be spontaneous earlier.
Ron: Yeah. 0x0ADave: You don't have as much time to be spontaneous.
Ron: It's on the calendar, spontaneity ends here. 0x0ADave: Right.
Tim: I remember for a long time, the characters were the wrong scale in this room, and Guybrush was like, really tiny compared to this giant guy...
...sitting at the end of the dock!0x0ADave: You're right... you've an amazing memory.
Tim: I only remembered the bad things. It was that way for a long time till someone pointed out and was like "That guy is 3 times as big as Guybrush". Oh, ...
...the library.0x0ADave: Didn't we have to make like a special big Guybrush to go in?
Dave: In the room? 0x0ARon: Yeah 'cos we didn't have that kinda scaling. We could scale down, but...
...we couldn't scale up.0x0ATim: But not up.
Dave: Yeah, just turn into giant pixels anyway.0x0ARon: But we had all those extra floppy disks, so we could just. As much of...
...that stuff as we wanted.
Tim: Ok the library, is it true Dave, did you write all the books that are in here? All of the book titles?
Dave: I didn't! I did do a lot of 'em but I remember we, I think we... we put out a call.
Tim: To all of LucasArts?0x0ADave: To everybody like, err, hey! We need book titles and I think Captain...
...Tripps actually wrote up a large number of them.0x0ATim: Oh really? Some of them I didn't realize were references to other things...
...in the game until I read them on, like, Monkey Island fan pages, like there were all these little hidden clues.
Dave: Yeah there's all kinds of references and stuff like that. References are fun!
Tim: Yeah. What was the one? Something about the ending, something about LeChuck, and the fight that he had with Guybrush.
Dave: There's a reference to that in the library?0x0ATim: Yeah, what does LeChuck say was the root of their fight? As children...
...like some, some...  Embarassing that I don't know. 0x0ADave: Do you remember?.
Ron: I don't remember...0x0ATim: The last scene when they were kids, and were like, we had this fight...
...over something really trivial, and there's a reference to it in the library.0x0ARon: When you think they're kids, you mean.
Tim: Oh, when the robots0x0ADave: Before the robots are programmed to think that they're kids.
Ron: Right, right.0x0ATim: That's what I meant. And they don't realize that they're dead, and...
...that one cute little boy who can see dead people.0x0ADave: Yeah, that part.
Tim: Ok, look at those references.0x0ARon: Yeah let's actually...
Tim: It's Sherlock Holmes! 0x0ARon: Lets go through all the library cards.
Tim: Yeah, could we look...0x0ARon: Lets go through them all
Dave: All of them? Aren't there like a hundred or...0x0ATim:  What's 1060 West Addison?
Dave: That is the address of Wrigley Fields.0x0ARon: Wrigley Fields.
Dave: From the Blues Brothers.0x0ATim: Oh my god... yeah.
Dave: That is in fact an explicit reference to a joke in which someone gives a false address. So, perfectly appropriate.
Tim: Stan... Look we took the costume from the original game and painted it black. Same animation.
Ron: It's that cost savings we had to do.0x0ADave: The pattern that moves with the coat was like, something that we did on...
...the 2D games to save ourselves a lot of effort, but as soon as they started making them in 3D then it became really hard.
Ron: Right.0x0ATim: Wait how do we replicate that effect?
Dave: I love any game that has a spitting contest. 0x0ATim: Look at that picture of the spit over there... the little banner with...
...the spitting mouth.. ugh ... what a gross game. Who came up with the spitting contest?...
...No one wants to own the spitting contest. No one's like "that's my baby. "0x0ARon: I think you programmed it though.
Tim: No... Oh yeah I did, I did the programming of it. Cos it was really challenging.
Dave: I liked the methods that were used to win; that was just cheat, cheat and cheat again basically.
Ron: It's your standard Guybrush adventure game. 0x0ADave: Our games are forming the morals of the youth of today, the social...
Tim: We're talking about pirates... can't teach positive moral values in a game about pirates. Pirates what do they do? They steal, they pillage...
...and we're just lucky that they left out the third one.0x0ARon: You know, I did all those adventure games for kids at Humongous...
...Entertainment, we really had to come up with very contrived reasons why you weren't just stealing everything that you had to pick up.
Dave: I remember having to write a lot of lines for Pajama Sam about that0x0Aand my take was always, Oh I found this I'd better try and find the owner and...
...give it back. And so, I'm carrying around all these things that were going to 0x0Ago back to somebody. Or if the person was there, he'd always ask to borrow it.
... Can I borrow that?0x0ARon: Because adventure games just do not teach children good habits at all.
Tim: But playing them can teach you valuable things like reading, English.0x0ARon: Stealing.
Tim: Pointing, clicking,0x0ARon: Spitting.
Dave: Spitting?0x0ATim: Saving often!
Tim: Do you remember how we designed the puzzles for this on the whiteboard and we purposely did the thing that we later thought made it too hard but we...
...put every island on the top and every puzzle chain on the side and then we made sure that there was an object on every island that you needed for every...
...puzzle chain? So that if you wanted to solve any long puzzle chain you had to visit every single island so that's why if you actually play this game you had...
...to go from island to island to island over and over and over again.0x0ARon: I remember in our discussions talking about, was that too annoying for...
...players to constantly going from island to island to island to solve things?0x0ATim: And you said I don't care I said 40 hours. It's gonna be 40 hours.
Ron: They've already bought it why do I care. 0x0ATim: I think the phrase you used was player be damned, right? That was one...
... of the catch phrase 0x0ARon: That's kind of my design philosophy really.
Tim: I worked on this part and there was a really funny bug where you make the chef mad at you and he chases you: around harassing you and I had a bug...
...where I didn't get rid of the chef, and make him go back home if you'd left the area so he'd follow you around the map but the thing was we'd re-use...
...actor numbers and he was like actor number 12 or something, and that actor was like Captain Dread's ship on the map so like, Captain Dread's ship would...
...follow you around the map yelling "You're some scum and I don't like you0x94 every room you went into, a different random thing would just harass you and...
...berate you.0x0ADave: Why didn't we leave that in?
Ron: Oh this I love. this was one of my favorite... my favorite parts here.0x0ATim: Wait wait when does this happen?
Dave: When he jumps off the ship and goes down.0x0ARon: There was big tech here.
Tim: Oh yeah, 0x0ARon: Because we wanted it to seem like a long time.
Tim: Oh, we did the scrolling...0x0ARon: With big scrolling...cause we didn't have vertical scrolling.
Tim: And the camera angle change, there was a camera angle change, because you look up at the boat...
Ron: It looks like it.. It's not a real camera angle change. 0x0ATim: Because there's no actual camera, because its 2D.
Ron: This was all 3D, this was all 3D.0x0ADave: There was some color cycling in there, no?
Ron: Yeah, we did color cycling for the water, and then we just moved...0x0ADave: Because there was no way to do a full screen effect with the technology of...
...the day, we ran on 286.0x0ATim: We actually had a red version of that, oh wait that was colour cycling, when...
...we turned the forest red for the bone dance. 0x0ARon: Must've been.
Tim: I thought he was gonna kiss that monkey head. I remember Steve Purcell saying "What am I gonna do with 256 colors?" Like he went from Monkey 1 to...
...2 and he's like "Too many colors! I cant take it!" For a long time all they did was add gradients; was like adding a gradient of colour in between everything.
Dave: Steve has this amazing ability to take a block of 8 by 8 pixel block of 16 colours then make it look like anything.
Tim: And that stuff is now these days cooler looking. Like you know how 8 bit art in general looks really hip and stylish now...
Dave: That's right, there's a whole new revival movement. 0x0ATim: With that in between like VGA. I don't know that will ever look hip and cool...
...in the same way that like EGA looked. Remember we had to go through the entire game and make it work in CGA?
Dave: Yeah.0x0ATim: Because some people only used CGA that weird gross combination of pink...
...and green.0x0ADave: There was like 2 blues 2 pinks or something.
Ron: It's like a cyan and a weird magenta.0x0ATim: But the game would work on our Hercules monitors too though.
Dave: That's right those monochrome monitors... that was our undocumented support.
Ron: Yeah, we never shipped to work on the Hercules Monitors. But we always had those separate...
Tim: It did though.0x0ARon: We always had those separate Hercules Monitors...those were our debug windows.
Tim: And we had a separate mac for our email, we couldn't be bothered to read emails somehow and emails didn't work on PCs back then I guess.
Ron: Why did we make this game so long? 0x0ATim: It's insecurity, I think obviously we were insecure, and we wanted to...
...make it bigger, and we had like a size issue.0x0ARon: We had short game syndrome from the first one.
Tim: No one ever complained about the first game, like nowadays, no matter what you do, people say your game is short. Back then, no one complained...
...did they complain about Monkey being short?0x0ARon: No, no, they didn't.
Dave: Just management. 0x0ARon: No, nobody complained about it.
Tim: Complained about it being long...0x0ARon: I just think we over designed it, and then we also cut, we also cut a lot out of the game.
Ron: I remember when you had that squirt bottle by your desk, and when people would come in and then they would talk to you for too long and...
...you would squirt them like we were cats.0x0ATim: And eventually everyone turned on me and they tackled me and like...
...Bret held me down underneath Tammy's desk and opened the lid on the squirt bottle and dumped it on my head.
Ron: And then you went home pouting.0x0ATim: No, no I did not.
Ron: Yes you did, you went home mad.0x0ATim: Well I was pretty mad. I was like, can't you take a joke.
Dave: Can't YOU take a joke?
Ron: See, this is another one of those puzzles where you're locked in one place.0x0ADave: Yeah I like those.
0x0ATim: I loved that bit of dialogue, I don't even know who wrote it, but he makes the bones...
...out of Guybrush's... He makes a chair out of his bones and he calls it a screaming chair because... I forget why, but it's awesome.
Ron: I think that came from that thing about HR Giger, he made a chair0x0Aout of his dead girlfriend.
Tim: Wait, no no no that was the guy...0x0ARon: Or maybe it's a myth that he did but I remember talking about that and I...
...think that's why we did that.0x0ATim: I thought there was some other guy, wasn't it the guy who shot his wife...
...with a bow and arrow and made chair and bones...? 0x0ADave: Who shot his wife with a bow and arrow?
Ron: Robin Hood?0x0ATim: The guy from Naked Lunch.
Dave: Oh Burroughs. Was that a bow and arrow? I knew he shot her...0x0ATim: He shot her with a gun and then he made a chair out of her bones...
...That's pretty gruesome, he probably didn't do that0x0ADave: That's pretty gruesome...
Tim: That's probably something I'm misremembered.0x0ADave: That's highly unlikely.
Ron: This is fun how you had to line everything up and get the spit that we used earlier.
Tim: Oh my god we have brilliant foreshadowing.0x0ADave: Amazing. Got all these nice green liquid to kind of motivate you to do that.
Tim: I used to sit next to Tabby Tosti, Tabby Tosti who ran the hint lines right outside my office, and I would listen to her give hints all day long. and it...
...was just, it was like "take this, take the map and go back here bla bla bla" She would just tell it. she wouldn't give hints like "well what do you think it is?"...
...she would just lay it out. 0x0ADave: People were paying money, they just want the answer.
Tim: Yeah, I guess so, but she would always answer the phone the same way "Lucasarts hint line CAN I HELP YOU?"
Ron: My favorite was when they would call for hints, and they would get the hint to do what to do, and then they would say, "and then what happens?"
Dave: And you'll find out...0x0ARon: Or try this...
Tim: Do they still have hint lines?0x0ARon: Probably no...
Dave: I think the internet destroyed it, but, for one brief glorious moment of history, that was like the biggest money maker for the entire company I think,..
...was the hint line.
Ron: This is where it all comes together and is explained fully. 0x0ATim: I think people might not understand this ending, because you have to...
...know a lot about numerology, and science, and there is a lot of physics references...
Ron: Food processing...0x0ATim: The Fibonacci sequence is incredibly important to this, all the clues.
Dave: I remember we went back and forth alot, or round and round I guess a lot...
...about the ending. You have it in your head and it was like, "I don't know,0x0Ashould we really do this, and we were trying to think of something different...
...that was going to be better. I think I may have actually convinced you to do 0x0Athe ending that we did, at dinner one night. It was like no, no. We should...
...just do it, it will be great, it will be kind of ambigious and seventies like...0x0ARon: I remember we went round and round and round...
Tim: I kind of remembered it more as an iterative thing that we like, we did...0x0A...one part and we're like let's add one more twist to it, and then let's add...
...another one again to make it like the first one didn't count, and let's add one more! It was hilarious.
Ron: Well, I think this ending gets mentioned all the time on, you know, top ten0x0Abest endings of computer games, is the ending to Monkey Island 2.
Tim: I think they complained about it.0x0ADave: It also ended up in the top 10 worst endings, it's like a very controversial...
...ending. People love it or they hate it.0x0ARon: But, see, isn't that perfect though? I'd almost rather pick something half...
...the people loved and half the people hated, than something a bunch of people felt mediocre about.
Ron: Do you remember these rooms it was just one background that we turned on and off the doors?
Tim: Generic room technology from Indy 4?0x0ARon: Yeah I think we had a patent on that.
Tim: You can see it there when it flashes like that.0x0ARon: Yeah, see that's when it was weird when you cut from one to the other...
...because certain things would not change and other things would change.0x0ATim: Cause originally, in Indy 4, where you go through the castle, and you go into...
...a room then go into a hallway, then you go into another room then you don't see it.
Ron: Right.0x0ATim: That was such a great game, is it Indy 3? Indy 3.
Ron: Last Crusade.0x0ATim: Yeah, Last Crusade, that's when you go into the castle...
Ron: The Last Crusade was when we first started doing the dialogue0x0Achoice things, and I think in Monkey 1 it was almost like the whole concept was...
...proved out in a way and then I think we went nuts on Monkey Island 2 with the dialogues.
Tim: When you hammer all the nails in Stan's coffin to trap him, I turned off Min Jiffies. There's a little SCUMM tip for you guys.
Ron: To sort of go really fast?0x0ATim: Turn off Min Jiffies so it would go really fast. But I think on a modern...
...computer it would go so fast that it would break the speed of light...0x0ARon: Go back in time?
Tim: Yeah it might cause a shift. 0x0ARon: It would undo several puzzles that they had done previously.
Tim: Remember turning off Min Jiffies it was like a Keystone Kops effect.0x0ARon: Well if you held down the shift key, you know in the debug mode, if you...
...held down the shift key, it would just turn off Min Jiffies so we could run around as fast as we want, yeah.
Tim: And so, when you can have the dialogue with Elaine, where you can either insult her, you had to grovel a bunch to win the puzzle they also get to have...
...the choice to insult her, I remember watching and this one woman who was playing it, and she couldn't figure it out, and 'I was like 'Hey, have you...
tried all the dialogues?' she's like 'Yeah, I've tried every dialogue option." 0x0AI was like "What about that one there? There is a dialogue option about "Have...
...you gained weight?" And she was like, 'I'd never say THAT to her!'0x0ARon: That's too far, that was the line.
Tim: Yeah, she was like, even to an imaginary video game character, I would never say "Have you gained weight"
Ron: These pants make me look fat.
Tim: How do you solve this puzzle? You blow the horn and that makes the canoneer fire his cannon? Why does he do that?
Ron: It's an adventure game, who knows? 0x0ATim: And then you have to watch that girl's belt to see if the wind is blowing.
Ron: To see if the wind... right... 0x0ATim: Oh and you have to move the flags.
Dave: You have to move the flags that's why you keep distracting people with the cannon, yeah? Yeah.
Tim: I like that new, save icon they have.0x0ADave: Oh so one of the things that you do is not cheating!
Tim: You distract a guy so you can move the flags, oh and then you're using wind. Which is also another thing a pirate has to do. As a sailor, understand
the wind. Understand the direction of the wind. 0x0ADave: You'll notice though with the green stuff that you make and drink...
...we sort of predicted the entire like all the other doping scandals in all the other sports.
Tim: Do you have to make special spit? 0x0ARon: Was he juiced? Is Guybrush juiced in this?
Dave: He's juiced, yeah. 0x0ATim: Oh juiced... I thought you...
Dave: The recipe of the green gunk that makes your spit hang together better.0x0ATim: Why would that make your spit fly farther.
Dave: It makes it hang together better. 0x0ATim: Wouldn't that make it also heavier?
Dave: Well, I'm not sure the weight of a glob of spit is the limiting factor there.You can spit it harder and...trust me, the last time I was in a spitting contest....
0x0ARon: Dave's going to write the science of Monkey Island book...
Dave: You know it vaporizes. That's the problem with chucking pumpkins too, is if you throw them too hard.
Tim: I like how, I think this is Peter Chan's own writing, the flags say "Spit" and "Fun." Why would you put that on a flag? "SPIT! FUN!"
Ron: That's why you don't let artists write. 0x0ADave: And what would you put on them?
Ron: It would be "Fun" and "Spit". 0x0ADave: Oh, well, that's much better.
Ron: Yeah, it rolls better.
Nice.
Nice.
Nice.
Nice.
