He's back.
I told you, we don't have any marshmallows.
 
 
\007Well, you guys can stop worrying about Largo^
\007I ever tell you about the time I kicked LeChuck's butt?
\007Tell me about this Largo guy.
\007So why don't you kick Largo off the island?
\007What's this about an embargo?
\007How's the pirate biz?
\007What's this about an embargo?
\007Any idea where I could hire a ship?
\007Do you guys know any piraty songs?
\007Do you guys know any more piraty songs?
\007Any marshmallows left?
\007Well, I'll see you salty dogs later.
Look, Guybrush^\255\003Besides the fact that we'd all rather die than hear that story again^
^there's another reason you shouldn't go spreading that story around.
Largo LaGrande is back on Scabb.\255\003He used to be LeChuck's right-hand man.
You don't want to get Largo on your bad side.
 
A two-bit thug!
He's nothing but a low-down weasel!
 
Well, we would^
But he was very close to LeChuck^
But LeChuck's gone forever!
I heard they never found his body!
That's because I blew it into a thousand pieces!
Oh, no.  Not this story again!
 
Horrible.
The sailing embargo has all of us pirates landlocked.\255\003We can't go about our business.
Some of us tried pirating on land, but it just didn't feel right.
You'll need to go to the far side of the island^
And there you'll meet a man named^
^Captain Dread!
Yikes!  Sounds intimidating.
Not really^\255\003^once you get to know him.
Of course, he can't take you anywhere until Largo lifts his sailing embargo.
 
The Largo Embargo!
Well, it's not really an embargo.\255\003It's a tax on ships coming or going^
But it's a HUGE tax that no captain on this island can afford.
Including Dread.
That fool Largo doesn't know when to stop.\255\003He can't take more from us than we have!
 
Sure!  Fink here knows a million!
Go ahead, Fink.\255\003Sing that one about Scabb Island.
Oh, all right^
Well, I'd rather be a pirate on Scabb^\255\001Than a scab on a pirate.\255\003And if you'll listen to me gab,\255\001I'll tell you why I admire it.
Oh, the people aren't too friendly.\255\001And the weather's not the best.
The lodging's too expensive,\255\001And Largo was quite a pest.
The lodging's too expensive,\255\001And Largo's quite a pest.
But the thing I like about Scabb\255\001Is what it hasn't got:
No mayor or police force\255\001And no jail in which to rot.
That was beautiful.
OK, here's one about a pirate, his parrot, and a tragic day at sea^
You're not going to sing, `Polly the Squawker Lives in Davy Jones' locker,` are you?\255\003You know that one always makes me cry.
Sorry, Bart.
Let me try one!
\007\255\004\095\001!
\007\255\004\096\001!
\007\255\004\097\001!
\007OK, that's enough.
Aw, I wasn't done.
Oh, I wish I could par-lay\255\001Some French with Governor Marley.\255\003I'd say to her, `Voo-lay-voo?`
OK!  That's enough!\255\003No songs about Governor Marley.
Looks like Guybrush is still carrying a torch for the Governor.
Too bad he can't even talk to her in English!
Sorry, Mr. Sensitive.\255\003The only other songs I know are dirty ones about Governor Marley.
Me too.
 
Marshmallows?
We don't have any marshmallows.
What's that white, puffy thing on the end of your stick?
It's the stuffing for under my eyepatch.
We're just sterilizing it.
We're pirates, Guybrush, not Girl Scouts.
He's history.
Oh really?\255\003He must have finally got that nasty letter I wrote.
You sure can write a mean letter, Fink.
That reminds me, do we have any weenies left?
 
So I bust into the church and say, `Now you're in for it, you bilious bag of barnacle bait!`
^and then LeChuck cries, `Guybrush!  Have mercy!`\255\003`I can't take it anymore!`
I think I know how he must have felt.
Yeah, if I hear this story one more time, I'm gonna be crying myself.
Don't you have any NEW stories?
Well, actually, that's why I'm here on Scabb Island.\255\003I'm on a whole new adventure.
Growing a mustache?
No.\255\003Bigger than that.
A beard?!?
No, I'm in search of treasure.\255\003The biggest treasure of them all.
A treasure so valuable and so well hidden, that it haunts the dreams of every pirate on the seas.
You mean^
Big Whoop?               \255\002
                               Big Whoop?
None other.
Then, why'd you come here?\255\003There's no treasure on Scabb Island!
Well, I didn't know that before!\255\003Now I'm trying to charter a ship and look someplace else.
When I return, I'll have riches galore, and a whole new story.
Or you'll have died trying.
Either way, we won't have to hear about LeChuck anymore.
Oh, \255\004\098\001 bottles of beer on the wall^

Where do you think YOU'RE going, fancy-pants?

On second thought, stop right there!
You ain't from these parts, are ya?
This here's a toll bridge.  You gotta pay.
\007Is this some sort of bribe situation?\255\009\025\000
\007Sure.  Take my money.  I don't want any trouble.\255\009\006\000
\007Who's gonna make me, shorty?\255\009\023\000
\007I don't pay for nothin'.  I'm a pirate!\255\009\027\000
No, more like extortion.\255\003Here--allow me to demonstrate.
Aw, there goes all my fun.\255\003Now I don't get to do this.
Tough guy, eh?
Help!
Police!
Ha ha ha!\255\003Scream as loud as you want!\255\003There are no police on Scabb Island!
\007Then who keeps up the law and maintains order?
\007Then who eats the donuts and roughs-up the transients?
\007Please!  Not in my new coat!
\007OK, put me down now and I won't have to hurt you.
I'm the only law on this island!
I roughs-up what needs roughing-up on this island!
Maybe I should make you one out of cement!
Ha ha ha!\255\003That's a good one.  Maybe I won't kill you right now.
Hey!  Yer loaded!
This is my lucky night!
Remember^\255\003Wherever you go^\255\003On sea or on land,
You can't ever hide\255\003From Largo LaGrande!
Guybrush
Tough town.\255\003I guess I should have got those traveler's checks.
 
Guybrush
This maybe a lot of money, but it's nothing  compared to how rich I'll be when I find Big Whoop.
I think I'm pretty well prepared, financially, for now.
I should be set for the whole trip with this.
This should be plenty of money to charter a ship.
Look at all this!
I've got enough to buy my own ship--in five different currencies.
I'll be traveling first class on this treasure hunt.
It sure took a long time to save all this.
No more part-time circus work for me.
Of course, this is only a fraction of what I'll have after I find Big Whoop.
Hmmm^  Maybe I should get a money belt.
I wonder what I'll buy first^
Boy, this stuff's heavy.
I could just look at this money all day.
Money, money, money.
I'm confused by this strange urge to squander my wealth on immoral and dangerous vices.
I wish all those girls who wouldn't go out with me in school could see this!

\007Nobody sent me.  I'm free-lance.\255\009\006\000
\007I was sent by the I.R.S.  Let me see your files.\255\009\007\000
\007Don't shoot!  I was just asking.\255\009\006\000
\007Well, well.  Aren't we jumpy?\255\009\024\000
The who?
You'd better not try for my files.\255\003All my research on Big Whoop is in there.
Well, that's a dangerous question.
I've been researching Big Whoop for years.\255\003There are a lot of people who'd like to get their hands on my files.
You would be too if you were me.
 
\007Are you looking for Big Whoop, too?\255\009\023\000
\007Can I see your files?
\007Where do you think it's buried?
\007I'm looking for Big Whoop myself.  Wanna help?\255\009\027\000
Well^
I haven't really been able to find out much hard information^
What do YOU know about it?
Actually, there's not anything in them.
I don't know if I'd be much help.
 
\007I know I'm looking for it, and that's about it.
\007I know it contains unimaginable wealth.
\007I know it's location is a mystery.
\007Um^ I really don't know much about it at all.
You mean, you never heard of the four men who buried it?
 
\007No.  Tell me all about it.
\007No, but I really don't care.
\007Oh, them?  Yeah, I know about them.  Of course.
Well, all anyone knows for sure is that there was a shipwreck.\255\003The merchant vessel Elaine went down in a terrible storm.
Elaine?
Only four crew members survived.
They washed up on a remote, deserted island.
Some say it's name was `Inky Island,`\255\003but I don't believe that.
\007Why don't you believe it?
\007Go on.  Finish the story.
\007But what IS Big Whoop?
Because there's no such island.
Anyway, that's where they supposedly found Big Whoop.
But what IS Big Whoop?
Whatever it was, it was so wonderful^\255\003^or so horrible^\255\003^that they never wanted anyone else to find it.
So they took the map they made of the island^\255\003^and split it up among the four of them.
And they all went their separate ways.
 
\007Wow.  That's some story.\255\009\024\000
\007Where are they now?
\007You don't actually believe that story, do you?
\007I love that story.  Well, bye!
Of course, it could just be an old legend.
But if I could just see the map of that island^\255\003^I bet I could recognize the shape of the land and track it down myself.
Well, I don't even know their names.
You know, that reminds me^\255\003I've got to get over to the Phatt City library and look that up^
^I'd go look them up at the Phatt City library^\255\003^if it weren't for this stupid Largo Embargo!
 
Well, well.\255\003Guess you don't need me, then.
 
\007Hey!  I did it!  Largo LaGrande left Scabb!\255\009\027\000
\007I have some more questions about Scabb Island.
\007I have some questions about Scabb Island.
\007Do you know anything about Big Whoop?
\007Could you tell me about the men who buried Big Whoop?
\007You know, I could just sit and talk about maps all day.
\007What exactly do you do here?
\007You know anything about this Largo guy?
\007How's business?
\007Is longitude the sideways one, or is that latitude?\255\009\025\000
\007Thanks.  I gotta go.\255\009\026\000
Would you mind if I just looked around?\255\009\026\000
No, no.  Be my guest.
If you see my monocle, let me know.
That's great.\255\003I guess I can stop with the bricks through his window now.
Hey!  Me too.
Who couldn't?
What else is there to talk about?
Well, hey.  That's my job.
Seems almost like we have.
Yep.
I can never remember which is which.
It's so cute when you laypeople try to understand geography.\255\003I could try to explain it, but it would probably just go over your head.
I'm a cartographer.
You do open-heart surgery?\255\009\007\000\255\003In here?
Uh^ no.\255\003I'm the mapmaking sort of cartographer.
Oh.
 
\007What kinds of maps do you make?
\007Is that all you do?  Make maps?
\007Ha!  Only sissies use maps.
\007Maps.  Huh.  That's interesting.  Well, see ya.
^but unfortunately I don't have all day.
Well, I do some restoration work too.
I paste them together, re-copy them^\255\003^paint little cupids in the corners^\255\003^you know.  Artsy-fartsy stuff.
Every kind a pirate could need!\255\003My eyes have seen the whole world, and there's not a part of it I haven't put down on paper.
Maps are very, very important.
 
\007Not to me.  I don't travel.
\007Actually, I prefer to just stop and ask directions.
\007You know anything about this Largo guy?\255\009\024\000
\007How's business?
\007I'm sure they are.  Well, good-bye.
So you've told me.
That's even better!\255\003With good maps, you can see the whole world without leaving your living room.
That's what Magellan thought.
Ha ha ha!
Sorry.  Cartographer joke.
Why?  Thinking about moving here?
Shoot.
 
\007Actually, I'm trying to get off it as soon as possible.
\007How can I get off this island as soon as possible?
\007You know anything about this Largo guy?\255\009\023\000
\007How's business?
\007Where's the Governor's Mansion?
\007I'm looking for some room and board.
\007Actually, I'd better not ask too many questions.
\007Thanks.  That's all I need to know.
Thanks for the lowdown.
Anytime.
Maybe you should talk to Captain Dread.
Good luck!\255\003With the sailing embargo Largo's imposed on Scabb, it's hard to get anywhere.
Which doesn't help my business, let me tell you.
Terrible!
No one needs any maps since no one can go anywhere thanks to Largo.
There is no Governor on Scabb!\255\003This is an anarchist cooperative of pirates, cutthroats, and other criminals.
A haven for roughnecks and rebels like me.
The only authority on this island is that bully Largo.
Well, I hear there's a new chef down at the Bloody Lip.
And the Swamp Rot Inn has all the comforts of the sea.
But I think Largo's booked the whole thing.
Okay.  But don't be shy if you think of a question.
He's just the local hood--shakes down everybody in town.\255\003Nobody comes or goes from Scabb because Largo makes them pay through the nose.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Okeydokey.
 
Hey!  Where's my monocle!\255\003I can't see a thing without my monocle!
Dang!  I've lost my monocle again!
What is that?  I can't see a thing!
All I want is my monocle.
I'd rather keep it.
 
Oh, there it is.  Thanks.
 
Ah, that'll work.  Thanks.
No thanks.  I already have a perfectly good monocle.
No thanks.
No thanks.
I have all the paper I need.
Pretty nice map, eh?\255\009\007\000
Of course it is.\255\003I made it.
What's this?  A map?
Hmmm^
Looks like only part of a map.
I can't make anything out of this.
It's incomplete.
Got any more of this?
I've got another piece right here!
Hmmm^\255\003Still not enough.
I've got some more pieces right here!
Hmmm^\255\003Almost, but a critical part is still missing.
I've got the rest of it right here.
Come back when you have the whole thing.\255\003Maybe I can help you then.
 
Hmmm^\255\003Very interesting^
Can you put it all together into one map for me?
I'll do it for you if you'll run an errand for me.\255\003Go to the International House of Mojo and ask the fortune teller if my love potion's ready.
Okay.
I'll try to have this done for you when you come back.
Nice map.
Yep.
Uh-huh.
Thanks.
I like it too.
Drew it myself.
Not for sale, though.
Where'd he go?
Someone's hastily scratched a message here^
It just says, `LeChuck.`
Oh, no!\255\003LeChuck's kidnapped the cartographer!
The poor little guy^\255\003Hey!  He has my map!
 
It just says, `LeChuck.`
Everything looks all blurry.
Yeah, me too.
Oh no.
Where is that thing?
I swear I put it right here.
I hope I didn't lose it.
I'll never be able to afford a new one.
How am I supposed to work?
Dang.
I'm such a dope.
Can't I do anything right?
Aw, shoot.
I bet my mom would help me find it^\255\003^if she were alive.
For crying out loud.
I hope it didn't roll onto the floor^\255\003Nobody move!
I can't belive somebody would STEAL it^
I'd go for help, but I'm afraid to walk around like this.
I'm stuck here forever!
I'm going to starve to death in here!
I'm going to die hungry, blind, and alone.
Why me?
I never hurt anyone.
Rats!
This stinks.
If I don't find it soon I'm going to lose all the monocle-grabbing muscles in my eye.
Here monocle.  Here boy.
Crud.

I don't want to hurt him.
I don't think he can use that right now.
Jojo already has a job.
Jojo's too into his music to notice.
I don't think that will work.
I wouldn't want to do that to an innocent monkey.
I don't want to disturb him.
I don't want to hurt him.

Hey!  Hired help only.
 
\007How's business?
\007About that job^
\007Hey^ Ah^ How's the stew tonight?\255\009\024\000
\007Grog, please.
\007Bartender, get me a drink.
\007Who's this Kate person?
\007I saw your sign outside.  What's the job?
\007Is that job still available?
\007Is that job available yet?
\007Wanna see my scar?
\007Nice place you have here.  Well, see ya.
I must be off now.\255\009\026\000
Shaken, not stirred.\255\009\023\000
Ha ha ha!\255\003Maybe you'd like a Shirley Temple instead?
I'm old enough!\255\003Look at my beard!\255\009\024\000
Ha!\255\003That's the oldest trick in the book!
Tell you what--I'll let you have some near-grog.\255\003It doesn't have any alcohol in it^
^but it's just as nasty-smelling and foul-tasting as that stuff grown-ups drink.
Right on!
Oh, wait.  What am I saying?
I just sold the last of it to Kate.\255\003Sorry.
Rats.
 
Of course, if you have some ID^
I'll need to see some ID for that.
\007Will you accept a temporary library card?
\007I must have left my ID in my other pants.\255\009\026\000
\007Who's this Kate person you mentioned?
\007In that case, I'll take my business elsewhere.\255\009\026\000
Aw, don't be sore, kid.\255\003It's the law.\255\003Let's just say I want to keep on the good side of it.
Why?\255\009\006\000
 
Sorry, kid.
You'll have to do better than that.\255\003No ID, no service.
 
It's the law.\255\003And let's just say I want to keep on the good side of it.
Why?\255\009\006\000
 
Let me see it.
Is Guybrush a French name?
No, actually it's a fictional name.
Oh.
Consultant?\255\003You look more like a flooring inspector to me.
Free-lance?\255\003Is that anything like a sanitary engineer?
No, not quite.
Well^
Unemployed??!\255\003Didn't I give you a job?
Yeah, but you fired me.\255\003Remember?
Oh yeah.
Uh^ It's an old card.
Oh.
Pirate?!\255\003We don't serve your type here.
Really?
No.  Just jerking your leg.
 
Alright^\255\003Can I get you that drink now?
\007Yeah, I could really use it.
\007Will you have more near-grog later?
\007Who's this Kate person you mentioned?
\007Maybe later.  I gotta go now.\255\009\026\000
Dang.\255\003Just when I thought I was going to do a little business!
 
Yeah, alright.
Ah, the Courageous Captain Kate Capsize^
Tough as steel, sharp as nails.
She rents her ship out^\255\003^does some free-lance pirating.\255\003Her only loyalty is to the highest bidder.
Don't get on her bad side.
 
Nope.\255\003Next shipment is a month from now.
 
OK, but gimmie back your empties^\255\003I'm running out of glasses.
Sure.
Now^
 
Name yer poison.
Whaddya got?
Well, we have some speciality drinks here at the Bloody Lip^\255\003Like:
Yellow Beard's Baby,\255\003Yellow Beard's Baby,\255\001Bloody Stump, and\255\003Yellow Beard's Baby,\255\001Bloody Stump, and\255\001Blue Whale.
 
\007I'll have Yellow Beard's Baby.
\007Give me a Bloody Stump.
\007Mix me up a Blue Whale.
\007Come to think of it, I'm not that thirsty.
Don't have the stomach for it, eh?
Well, you can try, but I don't think nature's on your side.\255\003Ha ha ha!
Just give me the drink, please.
Hey, I have to crack jokes.\255\003It's a union thing.
Here you go.
I can't.  Chain saw's out of gas!\255\003Ha ha ha.
Hilarious.
Yeah.  I crack myself up.
Here you go.
Sorry.  Blender's not big enough!\255\003Ah ha ha!
But seriously^
There she blows!
You haven't even finished the one you got.\255\003Come on.  Drink up.
Yep.\255\003Just canned my cook.\255\003You lookin' fer work?
Oh, yeah.\255\003I really should take that thing down.
I hired a new cook just this morning.
But, if things don't work out with him,  I'll let you know.
Sure is.\255\003You want it?
Sorry.\255\003That guy I hired is doing just fine, so far.
 
Depends.\255\003Is there a good story behind it?
As a matter of fact, there is.\255\009\024\000
It's a story of the Ghost Pirate LeChuck and his gruesome demise--\255\009\023\000
Heard it.\255\003This is the one where he drinks too much root beer and burps so hard he explodes, right?
Not exactly^
Frankly, I don't care much for stories that promote moderation in drinking.\255\003I do have a business to run, you know.
Largo LaGrande has left Scabb Island for good!
Well, well^\255\003I guess all those laxatives I was slipping into his drinks finally got to him.
What?!?
Don't worry.  I don't put them in all the drinks.
Are you interested?
Actually, I had to fire my last cook, so I don't have any fresh stew.
Stew?\255\003How gauche!\255\003We only serve gourmet chilled soups here.
In fact, our new cook has been working all day on a very special vichyssoise.
Let me go see how he's doing.
How's the vichyssoise, Bernard?
Excellent, sir.  Won't you have a taste?
I think I will^
OH MY GOD!!!\255\003What kind of demented recipe book are you using?!?
Hee, hee, hee!
You're fired!
But sir!
Out!\255\003Get out of my sight!
This is the most disgusting, filthy mess I've ever seen in my life!
Look at all the hair!\255\003And what's this stuff?\255\003How am I ever going to get rid of this junk?
Well, here's your soup.
Uh^\255\009\024\000
^I'm really not that hungry anymore.
Dang.
 
It's just terrible^\255\003No one ever comes down here anymore.\255\003Largo's got all my regulars spooked.
Because the law around here isn't the law at all.\255\003It's Largo!
It's not so much Largo as it is who his boss was.
What do you mean?
I'd rather not say any more about it.
Please?
No.
 
 
Hey, can you cook?
A little.\255\009\006\000
How'd you like a career in the fast-paced world of pub-food cuisine?
Are you saying there's an opening in the kitchen?\255\009\023\000
Yeah.  You interested?
 
 
\007Sure, I'll give it a shot.
\007No thanks.  I like being my own boss.\255\009\027\000
\007I dunno.  How much does it pay?\255\009\006\000
\007Can I have some time to think about it?\255\009\024\000
420 pieces of eight a week.\255\003First week paid in advance.
Great!  The job is yours.
Here's a week's worth of wages.
Now, go strap on an apron and get to work.
Okeydokey.
 
Well, come back and see me if you change your mind.
 
Sure, sure.\255\003Take your time.
 
 
Oh good.  You've come back.\255\003Are you interested in the job now?
 
Excuse me^
Yeah, boy?
And here's a complimentary crazy straw.
We give them to all new customers of The Bloody Lip.
 
You're supposed to be cooking.
I took my break.  It's the law.
The knives needed sharpening.
I went out for a smoke.
I was out of milk.
I had to go to the bathroom.\255\003Don't worry, I washed my hands.
Uh, I had to buy some eggs.
I had to go to the grocery store.
Nice try.\255\003But not good enough.\255\003You're fired.
Hey!\255\003Don't bug the monkey!
Hey, what'd you do to my piano player?
Thanks.\255\003I've been running low on mugs.
You keep it.\255\003I hate rats.
He can't play piano in that state.\255\003Keep him until he's better.
Leave my piano player alone.
There's not enough meat on it for a good stew.
I don't need that for anything.
Actually, I don't drink.
No thanks.
This drink's on me.\255\003I don't charge my regulars.
That'll be one piece o' eight.
OK.
I don't have any money right now.
I'll let it go this time.
I don't have any money right now.
I'll spot you this time.
Go ahead and take my entertainment.\255\003Thanks for nothing, buddy.
You know, I can mix any drink there is^\255\003^make anything you could name^
^but I can't make the one thing that could really do this island some good.
What's that?
Largo
A voodoo doll of Largo LaGrande!
You there!
(Uh-oh.)
Give me my usual.
And put it in a real glass!
Fork over the dough, or you'll be serving Bloody Marys for a week.
From your nose.
That's all I have.
Well, you'd better have more tomorrow^
^or we might have to move this dump to a new location.
Like, say, the bottom of the ocean?
Ha ha ha.
Boy, you just gave him all your money?
I don't want to talk about it.
 
I think I should save this for later.\255\003Maybe I can impress Elaine with how far I can spit.
I think I should save this for later.\255\003I'd like to show Elaine how far I can loogie.
I don't like to mix my drinks like that.
That didn't do much.
I already have a drink like this.
I'll just put them together.
 
Boy^\255\003This stuff makes my spit thick.
Well, take it outside, then.\255\003No spittin' in here.

That's why I carry this.
I'm gonna to tear you limb from limb!
How are you DOING that?
Largo LaGrande, you are a no-good, vicious, two-bit thug.\255\003I command you to give me back my money and leave this island!
Ha!  I already spent all your money!
Oh.
Well, I command you to leave this island!
Just you try and make--

That'll teach you to mess with the slayer of the Ghost Pirate LeChuck!

YOU killed LeChuck?
As a matter of fact, I did.\255\003Quite an interesting story, actually^
The fortune-teller said SHE did in LeChuck.
She did, did she?
Does SHE have one of THESE?
Is that^
Yes.  LeChuck's beard.
Still alive and wriggling.
Let me see that^
Boy, it IS alive!
We've been looking for a living piece of LeChuck for years!

HEY!  What are you doing in here?!?
Get out of my room!
And stay out!
Stop bothering me!
You're a pain!
Why are you following me around?
Every time I turn around you're there.
I can't believe you're in here again.
Didn't I kick you out of here before?!
It's people like you who make people like me who we are.
You're invading my privacy.
A man's room is his castle.
Why can't you leave me alone?!?
I oughta beat you up for coming in here.
You have some nerve, barging in here.
How dare you come in here again.
Get out of my face!
Get out of here!
Get away from me!
Oops.
Yikes.
Sorry.
Bye.

I don't want to be that close to him.

Maybe I shouldn't have done that.\255\003He looked pretty steamed.

GO AWAY!
Stop pestering me!
You again?!!
I was just leaving.
What are you doing in here again?!
Get out of my room!!
Scram, kid!
Leave me alone!
I thought I told you to get out!
It doesn't seem to stay closed.
I did a pretty good job on it.
That wouldn't be wise.
There's not much left to polish.
That would be redundant.
It would take forever to hack through it with this knife.
No need for that now.

I made Largo leave this island.
You made cards out of sand?\255\003Do I care?
 
I don't know anything about cargo or contraband!\255\003I'm clean, clean, clean!
 
Sure, sonny, I can get out stew.\255\003That's easy.\255\003I can also extract grog, spit, and swamp-mud.
That's because I'm Maaaad Marty.
I'm mad about getting your clothes the cleanest they can be.
 
Mad Marty
Shoot.
\007Would you be able to get out ketchup?
\007Do you do alterations here?
\007Actually, nothing.  I don't care about clean clothes.
Get out? Catch up?\255\003What do you want me to do?
Uh^ nothing.
 
Alter rations?\255\003You mean, change the numbers on your food stamps?\255\003You've got some nerve!
I'm sorry.
 
No, I don't have wheat loaves.
I didn't think you would.
 
Do you have your claim ticket, sonny?
\007Got it right here.
\007I'd like to keep my claim ticket for taxes.
\007It was stolen.
\007I must have left it in my other pants.
\007I dropped it in my grog and it melted.
\007Mom threw it out when she cleaned my room.
\007I lost it while being keelhauled.
\007NO, I DON'T HAVE MY CLAIM TICKET.
NO, I DON'T HAVE MY CLAIM TICKET.
You don't have to shout at me.\255\003I can hear you.
But, I can't give you your clothes without a claim ticket.
 
Taking it bowlin' was a dumb thing to do.
 
Why'd you trade it for chocolate-covered ants?
 
The log welted it?
Well, now that is a good excuse.
But I can't give you your clothes without a claim ticket.
 
What?? You beaned your mom with a broom?
You should treat her better than that.
 
Your dog got mauled?
What does that have to do with a claim ticket?
Oh, never mind.
 
What?  Your wife has fake lashes?
She got your claim ticket, or something?
No.  Forget it.
 
Great.
You're making me mad, Marty.
That's my name--don't wear it out.
Look.  I want it free^and I want it tonight.
Party tonight?  Sure, I'll come.
I'm talking about getting my laundry.
Don't worry about me.  I've been dry for three years.
I said, `I need it back tonight.`
What?  Yeah, we'll stay out all night.
This is useless.
You tell him I'll be back to pick it up^ or else.
 
I know it's here somewhere.
I saw it a while ago.
Now where was it?
I think I'd better make myself scarce instead.
Not now!\255\003Can't you see there's an emergency happening here?
Hey^
Hey, guys^
Yo^
Yoo hoo^
\007Ahem.
\007Excuse me.
\007Yoo hoo.
\007WAKE UP!
What is it?
\007Hi.
\007Long time no see.
\007Remember me?  I'm Guybrush.
\007Did you ever get that circus started?
Do we know you?
\007I'm Guybrush Threepwood, a mighty pirate.
\007I'm Guybrush, the man who rid the world of LeChuck.
\007I'm Guybrush.  You tried to sell me the minutes of a PTA \254\008     meeting in the last game, claiming it was a map.
\007I'm Guybrush, and I was just leaving.
How nice for you.
Sure, you are.
Map?\255\003Err^\255\003I don't know what you're talking about.
Fine.
No, really--
Why did you wake us up, Gorbush?
What is it this time, Graybrash?
What is it this time, Gooblush?
What is it this time, Flybrunch?
What is it this time, Frygoosh?
\007What are you guys doing up there?
\007How come you have to perform on that ledge?
\007What happened to your leg?
\007Say, I've got some time to get that polish now.
\007Is that your rat?
\007See you later.
We're performing.
That's right.
Performing.
In our current work we portray man's response to global environmental issues of a changing world.
It happened during a performance.
When he lost the leg, Frank was brilliantly showing the inseparability of the path man walks^\255\003^from the food chain.
The symbolism of the cheese was essential.
Yes.
We call him `Muenster Monster,` because of his insatiable passion for cheese.
We can scarcely contain our anticipation.
Ah^
^to show the precarious nature of the situation.\255\003^so to speak.
Right, right.
\007Oh, I see.
\007I think you're overlooking the potential symbolism \254\008     to be gained by your closeness to the earth.
\007Sounds like a crock of monkey snot to me.
You do?
Oh, good.
Err^
But^
Great.\255\003Here's some money for the polish.
All right, you got us.
We're really up here because^
^well^
We're afraid to come down.
What?
What's the word for it, Frank?
Err^\255\003Ahh^\255\003Hmm^
\007Dirtaphobia?
\007Groundaphobia?
\007Terrafirmaphobia?
\007Stupidity?
It's the opposite of acrophobia.\255\003Something like `orcaphobia.`
\007Fear of killer whales?
\007Fear of strange vegetables?
\007Sounds more like `workaphobia` to me.
Say what you will, we're not coming down.
You know, this leg is looking sort of dingy.\255\003Would you get some polish over at the woodsmith's and polish it for me?
\007Sure.
\007Give me the money for the polish.
\007Actually, I'm kind of busy right now.
Thanks.\255\003Here's some money for the polish.
OK.
OK.
That's what we do for a living now.
You see, after our circus failed, we started a pirate catering business on nearby Phatt Island.
`The Sacking Lunch.`\255\003It was quite lucrative.
\007Why aren't you still doing that?
\007What does this have to do with `performing?`
\007Then what happened?
I'm getting to that.
The governor of the island made us an offer we, er^
^couldn't refuse.\255\003So we sold him the business.
\007Yeah?
\007What did you do with the money?
\007But what does this have to do with `performing?`
We're getting to that.
We sank the money into one of those new-fangled glass-bottomed boats.
We wanted to take passengers on sight-seeing trips^
^and search for a place called Drinky Island in our spare time.
Boy, did we ever want to get there!
Aside from the obvious reason, we had inside information that Drinky was in fact the resting place of the legendary treasure of^\255\003Big Whoop!
\007Big Whoop?  I'm looking for that, too!
\007Big Whoop?  Er, did you find anything?
\007I don't see what this has to do with `performing.`
Well, I hope your luck is better than ours.
Not exactly.
We're getting to that.
You see, we got a bit of a raw deal on the boat.
Seems the salesman didn't have any glass for the bottom^\255\003^so he just left a gaping hole there.
By the time we noticed, we were taking on water fast!
We ended up stranded on a tiny desert island.
\007When do we get to the performing part?
\007How much longer is this story?
\007I think it's past my bedtime.
We met a philosopher on the island, and he told us something which changed our lives.
\007That you're a pack of loonies?
\007That you should bore passers-by to tears with \254\008     long stories?
\007What?!  What is it?!  What did he say?!  Tell me already!
He told us that all the world is a stage and that we are merely players.
So, we became performance artists.
Hey, leave that alone.
\007Sorry, is this your bucket?
\007Do you think you could let me have this bucket?
\007OK.
No.
\007Please?
\007Pretty please?
\007Pretty pretty please?
\007Pretty please with sugar on top?
\007Pretty please with sugar and a cherry?
\007Pretty please with sugar, nuts, and a cherry?
\007Pretty please with sugar, nuts, a cherry, \254\008     and chocolate sprinkles?
\007I really need it.
\007I really really need it.
\007I really desperately need it.
\007It's a matter of life and death.
\007If you don't give it to me I'll never speak to you again.
\007I'll be your best friend.
\007I'll be your best friend forever and ever.
\007Aw, come on, be a pal.
\007I didn't want that old bucket anyway.
Oh^\255\003^all right.
Well^\255\003^no.
So, you won't mind if I take it?
I guess not.
Thanks!
Here's a piece of eight for your trouble.

\007What's the problem with that Largo guy?\255\009\026\000
\007Nice apron.  Are you some sort of chef?
\007How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck \254\008  could chuck wood?
\007Could I buy some wood polish?
\007I'd just like to browse, thanks.
I'd like to look around a bit.
Sure thing.
That's one piece of eight.
Anything else?
Largo LaGrande will never bother you again!
Yeah, I heard Marty stuck a bunch of pins in his underwear or something^\255\003^drove him right out of town.
No, it was me!
You?\255\003What were you doing with Largo's underwear?
Ummm, well^\255\003Oh, never mind.
He really goes against my grain!
I'd like to make an end table out of him^\255\003but I don't have the guts.
With all my tools, I'm still unable to create the one thing that could do this island some good.
Like, an all-night tattoo parlor?
No, like a voodoo doll of Largo LaGrande!
Oh.
No, I'm a woodsmith.\255\003Which gives one of us an excuse for dressing funny.
A woodchuck could chuck no amount of wood since a woodchuck can't chuck wood.
\007But if a woodchuck could chuck and would chuck \254\008  some amount of wood, what amount of wood \254\008  would a woodchuck chuck?
\007Oh.  Shut up.
Even if a woodchuck could chuck wood,  and even if a woodchuck would chuck wood,  should a woodchuck chuck wood?
\007A woodchuck should chuck if a woodchuck could \254\008  chuck wood, as long as a woodchuck would \254\008  chuck wood.
\007Oh.  Shut up.
Oh.  Shut up.
Hey, you started it.
OK, but don't touch anything.
 
Thanks for returning that.
Funny.\255\003That looks just like my hammer ^\255\003^ which I have been missing.
Could you just put it back on the hook for me?
Just put it back on the hook and I won't press charges.

No.\255\003I just have this nagging feeling I left the gas on in my restaurant.\255\003It's driving me crazy.
 
\007Did I mention I'm looking for Big Whoop?
\007I'll check the gas for you, Rapp.
\007Did I mention you're dead?
\007Sorry.  Didn't mean to bother you. Rest in peace.
\007Give me the map and I'll check the gas.
\007You were right.  The gas was on.
\007Sorry to bother you.  Rest in peace.
Did you turn it off?
Uh^\255\003^no.  Was I supposed to?
Oh, will there ever be relief for my tortured soul?
I turned it off.
Thanks.
You can have my part of the map to Big Whoop--\255\003--but only if you do me a favor first.
Could you check the gas in my weenie hut for me?
 
\007What do you care about it?  You're dead!
\007Sure, I'll check it.
\007You were right.  The gas was on.
\007Give me the map and I'll check the gas for you.

Guybrush
Guybrush Threepwood.\255\003It's been a long time since you last came to see me.
Back again, Mr. Threepwood?
 
\007Wally sent me to pick up some love potion.\255\009\026\000
\007I got a book of voodoo recipes for you.
\007I really could use that re-vitalizing creme.\255\009\023\000
\007Hey, I've got some ashes for that potion.
\007About that jar I was looking at^\255\009\026\000
\007Do I know you from somewhere?\255\009\025\000
\007What kind of ingredients do you need for the doll?
\007About that voodoo doll^
\007Why don't you just put a curse on Largo?\255\009\006\000
\007Tell me about this Largo guy.
\007How's business?
\007I'd like to have my fortune read.
\007Just wanted to say hi.  Well, see ya.
\007Well, that's enough voodoo for me.  Bye.
It'll be much better once you use that voodoo doll on Largo!
Yeah, it worked pretty well, didn't it?\255\003I still have the touch.
Sorry, no returns on personalized voodoo products.\255\003If it's not working I suggest you get closer to your subject.
Oh, OK.
Tell him I said to enjoy, but to be careful.
It's powerful stuff.\255\003Wouldn't want that little guy getting hurt--
Wait!\255\003I just felt a sudden disturbance in the Force^
As if a tiny, tiny voice just called out in fear^\255\003^and then hastily scratched a message in a table.
I think Wally's in trouble, and I think LeChuck has something to do with it!
Uh-oh.\255\003I'd better go check.
 
Ah, we often forget those who help us most.
We do?
It was I who told you how to do away with LeChuck.\255\003I told you where to find the voodoo antiroot^\255\003^and how to turn it into the powerful ghost-dissolving potion you needed.
Oh, yeah.  Now I remember.
Very good.  Many hexes this week.\255\003Saved many people from the evil eye.\255\003Made many pieces of eight, although Largo took most of them.
He's a weak little man who bullies this whole island around.\255\003Most people are afraid of him because he was once LeChuck's right-hand man.
But LeChuck's history.  I got rid of him myself.
True evil can never be destroyed completely.\255\003You will see.
I see a hard road for you, Guybrush.\255\003Things didn't get easy for you when you defeated LeChuck, did they?
People only wanted more.\255\003You had to keep proving yourself over and over.
The pressure kept mounting until you lost it all--
Your fame^ your fortune^\255\003^the one you love.
OK, that's enough.
I've tried.\255\003My most powerful magic lies in voodoo dolls.\255\003But to make an effective doll I need some items from Largo's person, and no one's brave enough to go get them for me.
Are you willing to help me make one?
Uh, maybe.
To make it work you need to bring me some personal artifacts of the victim.
One from each of the four basic voodoo groups:
Something of the Thread^\255\003^something of the Head^
^something of the Body^
^and something of the Dead.
Hey, that almost rhymes.
For the Thread, I need a piece of Largo's clothing.
And a lock of hair will do for the Head.
Bring me a sample of fluid from his Body,
And from his Dead relatives you must acquire some remnant of a corpse.
Here--take this shopping list.
Thanks.
 
Do you have any of those ingredients with you?
I've got the real stuff back here.
That's one of my most powerful potions.\255\003But I only give it out in cases of serious need.
 
That's one of my most powerful potions.\255\003Brings the dead back to life.
Yes?
 
\007I'll take it!
\007I could do lots of cool stuff with that!
\007That doesn't sound quite proper.
\007I was just looking at it.  Can I go now?
There are some complications.
It only works on ashes, and the resurrection is only temporary.
Plus, you need to bring me a sample of the subject's ashes before I can mix you up a batch.
I have the ashes of somebody I'd like resurrected right here.
Boy, voodoo's complicated.
Rules are rules.
I can't make you any of that potion without some ash from the subject's remains.
Bring them to me.
Now, there's only one small problem^\255\003I forgot the recipe.
What?!
It's been a long time.\255\003I don't have that cookbook anymore.
I've got a book of voodoo recipes!
Good!\255\003How many crab scalps does it say to use?
Thirteen!
Good.\255\003That's just what I thought when I whipped up this experimental batch.
Thanks.
Remember, just a dab'll do ya.
I told you, I don't have that cookbook anymore.
What a drag.
Hey, I got a license!
So be it.
Now, go!
I've given you all the help I can, for now.
The rest is up to you.
Have you brought me the ingredients?
Have you brought me the final ingredient?
Have you brought me any more ingredients?
 
\007I have his toupee.
\007I have some of his spit.
\007I have the bone of his Grandfather.
\007I have this \255\006\044\001.
\007I'll bring them later.
\007I'll bring it later.
\007I'll bring you more later.
Hmmm^  Not quite a part of his head^\255\003But maybe I can get some scalp fragments from it.
spit encrusted paper
Excellent.
Perfect.
Yes, that will work.
Good.
 
You may keep the paper.
Do you have the final ingredient?
Have you brought me any other ingredients?
At last!\255\003Now I can make a voodoo doll to be reckoned with!\255\003Let me get my juju bag.
And now for the ingredients^
A dandruff flake from Largo's head!
A single piece of Largo's thread!
A drop of fluid from his body!
A single chip off the bone of the dead!
And finally, some miscellaneous voodoo herbs and seasonings, including monosodium glutamate.
This ought to be good.
Two!  Four!  Six!  Eight!
Who do we assassinate?
Largo!  Largo!  Yeah!
Hey!  That looks just like him!
Thanks, Voodoo Lady.
One more thing^\255\003Some of the ingredients were not the optimum specimens.\255\003It should still work, but it will have a limited range.
You will have to get close to Largo.\255\003Very close.
 
Nope.  What was that last one?
Nope.  Could you tell me what they were again?
Just like the list says^
Something from his body^
Something from his clothes^
Some of his bodily fluids^
Something from his ancestors^
^that's all we need to complete the doll.
^that's all.
 
I'm afraid it's true, Guybrush.\255\003If they have any animated tissue, they can reanimate his whole body.
But I blew his body into a zillion gooey pieces!
Not his body, Guybrush.\255\003You destroyed his spirit form.\255\003His body was safely buried far away.
But by now it must be^
Rotten?\255\003Partially decomposed?\255\003Yes.
And I don't think that's going to make him any more pleasant to deal with.
He's going to be looking for me!
Yes.
He's going to try to kill me!!!
Undoubtedly.
\007What can I do?\255\009\006\000
\007Where can I hide?\255\009\006\000
\007Can you give me something to protect me?
\007Can you just kill me now and get it over with?
You're already doing all you can.
What's that?
There is no place to hide.
But there is a way out.
What is it?
You're doing it right now.
Fiddling with the change in my pocket?
He has magic just as strong as mine.\255\003Nothing I could give you would protect you.
You must try not to lose hope, Guybrush.
There is a way out.
Hunting for Big Whoop.
Oh yeah, I was doing that, wasn't I?
Big Whoop isn't just a treasure.\255\003It contains the secret to another world.
Find that world and you'll be able to escape LeChuck forever.
But I know so little about Big Whoop^
Take this book.
`\255\006\100\000`\255\003Where'd you get this?
I checked it out at the Phatt City Library.\255\003I foresaw your need.
Gee, thanks.
I used your name when I checked it out, so be sure and return it when you're through reading.\255\003The overdue fines in Phatt City are pretty steep.
Gee^\255\003^thanks.
 
Guybrush, you don't have any time to waste!\255\003I can offer you no more help.
Your destiny is in your own hands now.

Hey!  That's just a display model!
No thanks, I don't need it.
I don't have any warts.
I don't have a cat.
After all, it is only a display model.
^and I feel bad for the skinks.
Voodoo's not known for its good smells.
I don't even want to know what it's used for.
I don't like heavy syrup.
^and I feel bad for the spiders.
I don't have that problem anymore.
I don't have an eyepatch or any missing limbs.

OK, `brother`, watch out, 'cause I've got my OWN doll, now!
Now all I need are a few voodoo ingredients.
Well, that's one ingredient and the doll.
That's \255\004\100\000 ingredients and the doll.
Well, that's one ingredient.
Now all I need is a doll.
That's \255\004\038\002 ingredients.
There's some stuff in here^
I think that these are matches^

I'd better ask about chartering a ship before I hand over my money.
Would you like my \255\006\000\064?

Thanks, mon!\255\003I was look'n for another lucky sailing necklace.
Thanks, mon!\255\003This will do just fine for my lucky sailing necklace.
What was that, mon?
No thanks, mon.

Hello?!?
Hello mon.\255\003My name's Captain Dread.\255\003What can I do for ya?
It's me again.
So I see.  What can I do for ya this time, mon?
\007I need to charter a ship.
\007Why can't I charter your ship?
\007I need to charter a ship.
\007Natty dreads.
\007Gee, I think I've met your friend.
\007Tell me more about that necklace thingy you lost.
\007I gotta run, lots of treasure hunt'n to do.
Like I said before, mon^
You're in luck, my friend.\255\003Rumor has it that Largo's been run off the island^\255\003^so I'm now free to sail again.
I can't charter you my ship because^
Besides^
 
Only problem is^\255\003^that you don't look like the type that has 20 pieces of eight.
Actually, I do have that much.
Well, mon!\255\003Consider my ship chartered!
Great!\255\003Where's your ship?
You're standing in it, mon.
Yikes!
Yeah, you're right^\255\003^I'm broke.
Unlikely.
Thanks, mon.
It happened sometime ago.
My navigator and I set sail for this legendary island.
When we arrived, we were taken prisoner by cannibals.
I escaped, mon, but my navigator was not so lucky.
All I found of him was one of his eyeballs, and I've kept it as a good luck charm.
OK, bye, mon.\255\003Come again.
Mon, I gotta take you back to Scabb Island.\255\003I got goods I gotta deliver.
Welcome to the Jolly Rasta!
Where do you want to go?
 
\007I don't know, what are my choices?
\007I'll show you on the map you gave me.
\007Please take me to Booty Island.
\007Please take me to Phatt Island.
\007Please take me to Scabb Island.
\007I'd just like to cruise aimlessly for a while.
\007I'd like to go back to the island I just left.
\007You know, I used to go out with Governor Marley.
What happened to the map I gave you?\255\003We'll never find the island without it.
I'll go back and get it.
 
OK, just let me know when you want to get someplace.
I only know how to get to three islands, mon.
What are they?
There's where we just came from, Scabb Island.\255\003The only island where pirates are free to be pirates.
Then there's Booty Island.\255\003The festive, French, Mardi Gras, party-all-the-time, island.\255\003It's run by one of the most respected and loved governors around^\255\003^Governor Elaine Marley.
Elaine?
And last, there is Phatt Island.\255\003A fascist dictatorship, run by an over-bloated pig named Governor Phatt.
Here, take this easy-to-read reference map, courtesy of Dread Tours.\255\003You can use it to show me where you want to go.
Sure you did, mon.
OOPS!  It didn't work right.  See traveldialog.scu
 
I lost my lucky `eye that has seen the world` sailing necklace.
^a while ago, I lost my lucky sailing necklace.\255\003I called it 'my eye that has seen the world'.\255\003I can't sail without it.\255\003No way, mon.
^Largo has an embargo on the island.
^That mean and nasty guy, Largo^\255\003^he has an embargo on the island.
No ships can sail in or out without his approval.\255\003There's no way he'd let me leave.
I love a house with that nautical look.

Well, I got half the map now^\255\003^but I still can't figure it out.

Right on!
 
Excuse me, sir.
Yes?
Aren't you Guybrush Threepwood?
\007That's right.  I'm the man who swashed the Ghost Pirate \254\008     LeChuck's buckles.\255\009\027\000
\007Who wants to know?
\007No, my name is Smith.  You must have me confused with \254\008     someone else.\255\009\024\000
\007I'm really in a hurry.
I'm sure that's a very interesting story, but we don't have time for that now.
Smith, eh?\255\003That's an unusual name.
Hold on, sir.
Perhaps you have some identification?
\007Err^ I must have left it in my other pants.\255\009\024\000
\007Why yes, I-- GOOD HEAVENS!!  My wallet's been stolen!
\007Look behind you, a three-headed monkey!\255\009\007\000
\007My ID is on my ship.  Wait here while I go and get it.\255\009\026\000
That's the second lamest excuse I've ever heard.
Of course it has, sir.
Nice try, Guybrush.
I'm with the local constabulary, sir.
You'd better come with me, Governor Phatt would like a word with you.
\007All right, I'll come with you.
\007Am I under arrest?\255\009\025\000
\007I'm really very busy.  Could we do this another time?\255\009\023\000
If you want to put it that way, sir, yes.
Oh.\255\003All right, let's go.
Coming!
Well, Mr.--
--oh, excuse me.
Well, Mr. Threepwood, I can't tell you how pleased I am to have you here as my guest.
\007Oh, why is that?
\007I can't say as I care much for your method of invitation.
\007Thank you.  Your home is lovely.
\007Would you like to hear the story of the time I blew \254\008    LeChuck's top?
\007Look, I'm really in quite a rush^
I thought we might talk about a few things.
I simply wanted to insure that you didn't slip away before we had a chance to meet.\255\003There's something I'd like to discuss.
You have an eye for the finer things, Mr. Threepwood.
Ha ha ha
Funny you should mention LeChuck, as he's the reason I brought you here.
You wanted to thank me for getting rid of him, eh?\255\003Well, no thanks are necessary.\255\003You see, I--
Oh, do stay a while.
We have much to discuss.
\007Such as how much it must cost to keep you in finery?
\007Such as how much it must cost to keep you in food?
\007Such as why there's a wanted poster on the wharf with \254\008    my picture on it?
\007Such as why there's a ten-foot guard blocking the door?
\007Want to hear about me destroying the evil LeChuck?
Be careful upon whose toes you tread, Mr. Threepwood.
Such as your future, Mr. Threepwood.
And that of the Ghost Pirate LeChuck.
`Destroying,` is it?
\007At least I can SEE your toes.
\007I'm sorry.  I just meant that you seem to live so WELL^
Why, you--\255\003--excuse me.
Let's get down to why you're here, shall we?\255\003I intend to SELL you.\255\003To the Ghost Pirate LeChuck.
Ah, I see.
I admit my tastes run to the expensive.
\007To the exPANsive is more like it.
\007How do you manage to afford it?
I am not a patient man, Mr. Threepwood.
Yes, I've had to indulge in a bit of creative financing.\255\003But I've just made a deal that will keep the bill collectors out of here for a long time.
\007Selling your old clothes to make circus tents?
\007Melting down your silverware to build an oil pipeline?
\007Renting yourself out to ship captains as ballast?
\007Selling advertising space on your stomach?
\007Oh really?  What's that?
I'll be selling something which I believe I shall be GLAD to be rid of.
I'm selling YOU, Mr. Threepwood.
To the Ghost Pirate LeChuck.
LeChuck's dead.\255\003I killed him.
Perhaps you didn't kill him quite so thoroughly as you imagine.\255\003He looked perfectly healthy the last time I saw him.
Last time you saw him?!?
Oh, no!\255\003LeChuck's back!
I beg your pardon, did you say something?
\007I took care of LeChuck once, I can do it again.
\007He doesn't scare me.  Just tell me where I can find him.
\007Could I hide out here for a while?
You'll get your chance.
I rather think he'll find YOU, Mr. Threepwood.
You can hide out until LeChuck comes to pick you up.
You see, he's put a sizeable bounty on your head.
Oh?
A bounty I intend to collect.
Oh.
\007Whatever bounty LeChuck's offering, I'll double it.
\007I guess that bounty would buy a lot of bacon grease and \254\008    pure fat, huh?
Ha ha ha
Very amusing, Mr. Threepwood.
Why, you!\255\003You can figure it out while you wait in jail for LeChuck to pick you up.
Take him away!
Yes, sir, Governor Phatt.
Come on, you little weasel.
\007I'll be back!\255\009\007\000
\007I'll be BACK!\255\009\007\000
\007I'LL be back!\255\009\007\000
\007I'll BE back!\255\009\007\000
Come on!
Don't try to escape or anything.\255\003Walt will chew you to bits.
OK, Walt, I'll be back to relieve you at eleven.
 
Excuse me.
Yes?
Aren't you Guybrush Threepwood?
No, my name is Kate Capsize.\255\003You must have me confused with someone else.
Kate, eh?\255\003That's an unusual name.
Perhaps you have some identification?
My ID is on my ship.  Wait here while I go and get it.
Nice try, Guybrush.
I don't know how you got out of the jail, but I'm taking you back in.
Hey, don't touch that!\255\003It's precisely balanced for maximum hydrophonic fibrilation.

More than I could ever eat!
\007I'm Guybrush Threepwood, a mighty fisherman.
\007I'm a game warden.  I'll have to confiscate your pole.
\007Well, I gotta go.  Good luck.
Oh, you are, are you?
\007I'm the best fisherman in these isles!
\007I'm also the man who caught the notorious LeChuck!
\007Yeah!
I beg to differ with you:
I'M the best fisherman in these isles.
Yeah, RIGHT.\255\003If you fish as poorly as you lie, you don't even deserve to be talking to me.
I'm the best fisherman in these isles, you know.
Oh, yeah?
\007You?  Why, you couldn't fish your way out of a paper bag.
\007You?  Why, you couldn't catch cold in a blizzard.
\007You?  Why, you couldn't catch a fish at a restaurant.
\007Not!
What?
What's THAT supposed to mean?
The pike I catch make Pike's Peak look like an anthill.
That's why I'm known as `The Blowfish.`
\007You mean `The BlowHARD.`
\007I'M known as `The Sturgeon Surgeon.`
\007The fish you catch are so small you'd need tweezers to \254\008     throw them back.
\007Oh, yeah?
^
Listen bait-for-brains, I'm the best around and that's that.
\007Not if your hooks are as dull as your wit.
\007Not if your bait is as tiny as your brain.
\007Not if your line is as weak as your lines.
\007Not if your reel is as rusty as your imagination.
\007Not if your lures are as ugly as you are.
Perhaps you'd like to make a small WAGER, eh, Mr. Fisherman?
You're a game warden, eh?\255\003Let's see a badge or something.
\007I must have left my badge in my other pants.
\007I don't have to show you any stinking badge.
\007Actually I'm Guybrush Threepwood, a mighty fisherman.
\007Look behind you, a three-headed fish!
\007I think I'd better be going.
Hah!
I think so, too.
I think you're just trying to get your hands on my pole.
Do you fish?
\007Of course.  Why else would I want your pole?
\007I'm the best fisherman in these isles.
\007No, actually I've never been fishing in my life.
\007Why do you want to know?
Well, I was just thinking about a small WAGER.
Are you a betting man?
\007Sure, I'll take your bet.
\007No, I'm not a gambler.
\007What sort of wager were you thinking of?
Let me tell you what I had in mind first.
Pity.\255\003It would have been^\255\003^interesting.
If you can catch a bigger fish than I can^
^I'll GIVE you my prize-winning pole.
\007Sounds fair.
\007What's the catch?
\007Kiss your pole goodbye.
\007But I don't even have a hook!
Improvise.  I'm sure you'll think of something.
If I catch a bigger fish than YOU^\255\003^you have to eat it.\255\003RAW.
\007Raw?
\007RAW?!?
\007You mean, on rice with a little wasabe and soy sauce?
\007Ick.
\007Where'd you get that other pipe?
No.
Exactly.
ahem
What?
Like I say, you'd have to eat a raw fish.
Plain, cold, and with the head still on it.
What do you say?
\007All right, it's a bet.
\007It's a revolting idea.  I can't think of anything I'd \254\008     less rather do.
\007I need more time to think about it.
OK.\255\003Let me know if you change your mind about being a wimp.
OK.
I'll be right here.
Great!\255\003I'm really looking forward to making you eat my catch.
What with all the sewage from Governor Phatt's mansion, the fish are usually pretty gross.
I never eat mine, just sell them to restaurants.
Best get fishing, buddy.
Heh heh heh.
Catch ya later.
<chuckle>
 
Nice pole.
Thanks.

She looks kind of surly.
I wouldn't want to.\255\003She's not my type.
Bad idea.

Everything looks all blurry.
Looks powerful.
model lighthouse lens
This looks like a lighthouse on a beach.
It doesn't open.
It's already open.
There's a model lighthouse lens inside.
Uh-oh, it's stuck.\255\003I think I broke it.
It's not open.

There are so many books here^\255\003I'll never be able to find anything.
I don't want to carry that many books with me.
I don't think that would be a good idea.
I can't read that fast.
What, every single one?
They look closed to me.

temporary library card
\007Excuse me^
\007Hi, I'm looking for a book.
\007Want to hear a fantastic ghost story?\255\009\023\000
SHHHH!!!!
This is a library!
WHISPER!
Now, what is it?
Pardon me, Miss.
What do you want this time?
\007I'm looking for a book.
\007Why do you have a model lighthouse here?\255\009\026\000
\007Sorry.  I didn't mean to bother you.
Then why did you?
There's a new lighthouse being built in town.
That is a scale model of what it will look like.
\007It's very attractive, for a lighthouse.
\007Does it work?
\007Why do you need a lighthouse?\255\009\006\000
Yes, and it will be very bright, too.\255\003It will have one of the most powerful magnifying lenses in the Caribbean.
I'd show you with the model, but unfortunately the bulb has burned out.
It wouldn't be much of a lighthouse if it didn't, now would it?
Actually, I meant the model.
Oh!\255\003Yes, normally the model works, too.\255\003The bulb is burned out right now, but there's a scaled-down lens inside.
We're tired of rebuilding the wharf every time a boat goes through it.\255\003That's why it has to be very bright.\255\003It will have one of the most powerful magnifying lenses in the Caribbean.
 
Do you have a library card?
\007No.
\007No, how do I get one?
\007I must have left it in my other pants.\255\009\026\000
Well, would you like one?
\007Yes, what do I have to do?
\007No, thank you.
Then stop wasting my time.
But you DO have one?
\007Well^ no.\255\009\025\000
\007Certainly.
I'll have to issue you a temporary card.
I said you could only check out four books at a time.\255\003You'll have to give some back before you can check out any more.
What book are you looking for?
\007Do you have '\255\006\163\000'?
\007I'd like '\255\006\162\000'.
\007Could you find '\255\006\161\000'?
\007I need '\255\006\160\000'.
\007I don't know, what have you got?\255\009\006\000
\007I won't be needing any more books just now.
\007Whoops, I've just remembered an appointment.
You already have four books checked out.\255\003You'll have to give some back.
You've already checked that book out, Mr. Threepwood.
You've already checked that book out, Captain Dread.
You've already checked that book out, Mr. Toothrot.
That book has been checked out by Governor Phatt.
OK, here you go.
That's your limit.\255\003You'll have to give some books back before you can check out any more.
Anything else?
Don't slam the door on your way out.
Remember, books are the treasure of the mind.
Remember, silence is golden.
Please put the lens back in the lighthouse.
You expect me to name every book in the library?
Use the card catalog like a normal person.
I'll need some personal information.
Name?
\007Guybrush Threepwood.
\007Captain Dread.
\007Herman Toothrot.
Address?
\007221B Baker Street.
\00710 Downing Street.
\0071060 West Addison.
\0071600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
Age?
\007Ummm... twenty-one.\255\009\024\000
\007Errrr... twenty-one.\255\009\024\000
\007Ninet --uh--, twenty-one.
Occupation?
\007Consultant.
\007Free lance.
\007Unemployed.
\007Pirate.
Vices?

I see.
All right, here's your temporary card.
All right, your library card will be mailed to the address you gave me.
In the meantime, take this temporary card.
You may check books out of the library, but only four at a time.
That's about as many titles as I can remember anyhow.
Thank you.
Please put that back where you got it.
No thank you.
SHHH!!
This is a library!!
Please, be quiet!!
You're disturbing people!
Lower your voice!!
This is not `hog-calling` practice!!
I won't ask you again!

They buried their treasure along with plenty of--

--booby traps on a place believed to be called Inky Island.
It says here there were four pirates:
Rapp Scallion (the cook)^
^Young Lindy (the cabin boy)^
^Mister Rogers (the first mate)^
^and Captain Marley.
They buried their treasure along with plenty of booby traps on a place believed to be called Inky Island.
They made a map which they divided into four pieces, each man taking one.
Rapp Scallion later opened the Steamin' Weenie Hut on Scabb Island.
It was a huge success but fell into disrepair after Rapp was killed in a flash fire.
Young Lindy drifted aimlessly, down on his luck until he mysteriously came into money while panhandling on Booty Island.
He used the cash to bankroll an advertising firm which failed after its gross mishandling of the Gangrene 'n' Honey account.
Mister Rogers retired off the coast of Phatt Island.
He marketed homemade contest grog brewed in a bathtub until his recent disappearance.
Captain Marley vanished while sailing in the America's Cup race.
His boat was leading at the time.

Yes?  What do you want?
\007I was wondering if I could come in for a minute.
\007I'm selling these fine Corinthian leather jackets.
\007I'm conducting a survey.  May I ask you a few questions?
\007Is the lady of the house home?
\007I'm looking for a map.
\007Oops.  Wrong place.
What do you REALLY want?
\007I'm looking for a map.
\007I heard about this guy who used to live here ^
\007I'd like to find out some information from you.
\007Sorry to bother you.  I'll go now.
I knew it.
Look, kid:\255\003I'm sick of you would-be treasure hunters comin' over here.
I just inherited this house two months ago.\255\003And every single day, all I've heard is `**rap tap tap**  Do you have a treasure here?`
Why can't you people just go away and leave a retired pirate in peace?
\007All I want to do is come in for a minute.
\007Please.
\007Pretty please.
\007I won't touch anything.
\007I'm Guybrush Threepwood.  Prepare to die.
No.
I said `NO!`
Leave me alone.
I'm tired of being hassled.
So ^ you want to sword fight, do you?\255\003Sword fighting is for wimps, weenies, and sissies.
Giving up so easily?
Wow, this game's a cinch.
I have a better way to solve a dispute.\255\003Real pirates solve their differences with a drinking contest.
 
Drinking contest?!
Come on in.
 
I'll get us set up.
This is my special grog.\255\003It's just for contests.\255\003Twice the alcohol, twice the calories.
I can't believe you're back for more.\255\003Most people just give up and go away.\255\003In fact, I'd really like it if you went away.
Don't you know when enough is enough?\255\003You know you're not going to beat me.\255\003I'm the best at this contest.
I wish I'd never bought this house.\255\003It's only caused me trouble.\255\003All these treasure hunters wanting to come in.
Excuse the boxes.\255\003I haven't had time to put them all away.\255\003Especially with all the people trying to get into my house.
I hate having to waste it.
Well, I guess you're serious about this contest.
OK, let's get on with it.
But I guess you want to go through with this.
Here's your drink ^

Oh.  Your grog's a funny color.
It might have spoiled.
From what I'm told,\255\003Nobody can drink the special contest grog without feeling faint.
There's a special drink that I like.
You ever tried booze from the West?
I used to like this drink when I was younger ^
I found this great drink from a foreign land.
On the ship, we had a drink that we couldn't live without.
My usual drink used to be a strange drink made by cannibals.
But I've been practicing.
It's a bit on the bitter side.
Makes your lips pucker.
It's rather sweet.
It's smooth as a pirate's savvy.
It's sharper than a forked tongue.
Tastes just like chicken.
You know, most of the treasure hunters just leave when I ask them to.
But it's powerful medicine.
But it's weaker than a sponge soaked in water.
But it hurts as it goes down.
But it slides down the throat like fire.
But it's stronger than a mule team.
But it's got a wonderful aroma.
But you.\255\003You're persistent.
I guzzled it with the best of them.
Never could get enough of that stuff.
Used to drink it all the time.
I had cases and cases of it\255\003All in one day.
Used to drink barrels and barrels of it.
My buddies and I drank it faster than we could open the bottles.
It'll get you places in life, boy.
I could give it up anytime I wanted.
Then I came to my senses.
Then there was a shortage of it a few years ago.
Then my supply ran out ^\255\003And my girlfriend went with it.
Then the taxes on it were raised.
Then I realized that I relied on it to get up in the morning.
But it won't get you into my house.
But I needed something else,\255\003so I drank rum.
So I started drinking rum to fill the gap in my life.
That's why I started drinking rum.
That was when I took up rum.
My next drink of choice was rum.
So I switched to drinking rum.

Hello again.
Hello there.
\007I just stopped by to say hello again.
\007I said HELLO THERE.  My name's Threepwood.
\007I'd like to introduce myself.  My name's Threepwood.
\007What kind of mishaps were there at the treasure hunt?
\007Hey, old man.  How about blowing off the cannon?\255\009\007\000
\007And what are the official purposes of this cannon?
\007Whatcha lookin' at?
\007You don't have a brother named Marty, do you?
\007Nothing.  Never mind.  Bye.
\007Well, I'm off.\255\009\026\000
Maybe I'll just wait until you do.
Oh, why hello there Threepwood.\255\003You in town for Mardi Gras?
Oh yes.  Well, are you enjoying Mardi Gras?
 
\007No, I'm on a treasure hunt!
\007Hey, if it's a party, I'm there.\255\009\027\000
\007Is this the right time of year for Mardi Gras?
\007What kind of mishaps were there at the treasure hunt?
\007That's where I'm going right now.  Bye.
Yep.  Can't talk now.  Having too much fun.
You kids today^
^always on the go-go-go.
What?  They doin' a treasure hunt again this year?\255\003I can't believe they'd try that again after all the mishaps last time.
 
\007Dang!  There goes all my fun.
\007I meant a REAL treasure hunt.  You know.  For money.
\007What kind of mishaps?
\007Well, I'd better let you get back to work^
Well, if it's a party your looking for^
Son, it's always Mardi Gras on Booty Island.
Well, if it's fun you're looking for^
Well, there's always Governor Marley's party.
I hear Governor Marley is having some super shindig up at her mansion.
 
\007Marley?  That's funny.  I used to date a Governor Marley.\255\009\025\000
\007How do you know so much about parties?
\007Maybe I'll just go up there now.  Bye.\255\009\026\000
Sounds fun.
Maybe I'll go there right now.\255\009\026\000
Yeah, live it up while you're young.
Yeah, live it up while you're young.
Oh sure^\255\003And I'll bet you helped her beat LeChuck, too.
 
\007You'd better believe it!\255\009\007\000
\007No, I beat him all by myself!
\007Don't laugh.  I've got the proof right here^
\007You're right.  I'm lying.  I'm so ashamed.
^in my pock--\255\003--whoops.  Uh^
Hey, hey, kid.  It's OK.\255\003Mardi Gras is the time for fantasy.
Now just run along and enjoy yourself.
I used to be the governor of this island.\255\003But I never had any time to come down here and enjoy the party.
So I quit, and now I watch out for the mail boat.\255\003Which reminds me, I have to get back to work.
For money?\255\003Look, son, this ain't some back alley on Phatt.\255\003If you're looking for gambling you've come to the wrong place.
Well, some people got carried away^\255\003^some graves got dug up^\255\003^horrible business.
How about just blowing off?\255\003My name is Augustus DeWaat, not `old man.`\255\003And this cannon is for official purposes only.
I watch the sea, and when the mail boat arrives, I blow this cannon.
Dang ship's three days late.
Boy, the only Marty I know is Marty Graw!
Who?
Mardi Gras!\255\003It's a joke, boy, a joke.\255\003You are here for Mardi Gras, aren't you?
Well, enjoy Mardi Gras.
 
Augustus DeWaat
Sorry son, didn't have my horn out.\255\003Could you say that again?
Eh, what was that?
You talking to me, boy?
You again?\255\003Still mumbling, I see.
Speak up!\255\003There is a party going on, remember.
What was that?\255\003Are you lost?
How am I supposed to keep my ear to the sea with you bugging me all the time?
Eh?
Cruises!
Sightseeing!
Sunken Galleons!
Glass-bottom boat!
Check it out!
See the world!
Three-hour tours!
Last day before I leave for Phatt Island!
 
\007By the way, my name's Guybrush.
\007Hi, my name's Guybrush.
\007Could I have one of those leaflets?
\007I'm ready to head out again.\255\009\026\000
\007I'm ready to set sail!\255\009\026\000
\007I'm interested in chartering a ship.
\007Are you the same Kate who bought all the near-grog \254\008    at the Bloody Lip?
\007I'm searching for the treasure of Big Whoop.
\007I just remembered I'm late for a party.\255\009\026\000
Captain Kate
I'm Captain Kate Capsize.
Like to charter a ship?\255\003I do weddings, funerals, bar mitzvahs, you name it.
Yeah, OK.
Hey, these things cost money.
Great!
Not many people want to charter a glass-bottomed boat around here.\255\003Pretty soon I'm off to Phatt Island to try my luck there, but let's talk turkey first.
Yeah, and you can't have any of it, so don't ask.
You and everybody else on this island.\255\003If you need a ship, you know where to find me.
OK, show me where you want to go this time.
Yeah?\255\003When I was first mate on the Limping Limpet we went in search of Big Whoop.\255\003We'd heard it was buried under a place called Blinky Island.\255\003Never found the island OR the treasure.
The captain eventually died of boredom while we were crossing the Sea of Beige Flotsam.\255\003Hope your luck is better.
My fee is 6000 pieces of eight.
As I mentioned, my fee is 6000 pieces of eight.
\007Don't you think 6000 pieces of eight is a bit high?\255\009\025\000
\007I'm afraid I don't have any money.
\007All I have is \255\004\049\001 pieces of eight.
\007OK, I'll pay you the 6000 pieces of eight.
\007Do you give credit?
\007I'll come back later.
No, I don't.
Well, perhaps you'd better get some.
I guess you'd better find some more, then, huh?
You've chartered yourself a ship.
My name's Kate Capsize, I'll be your Captain.
Are you ready to leave now?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
OK, I'll be here.
\007Yeah, I'm hot to find the wreck of the Mad Monkey!
\007Yeah, let's blow this popsicle stand.\255\009\026\000
\007No, I need to take care of a few things first.
\007I'm not sure where I want to go.\255\009\006\000
Have you got a course planned or anything?
I can show you where I want to go on this map that Captain Dread gave me.
Let me know when you're ready to head out.\255\003I'll be here.
You'd best figure that out, then come back and let me know.
I don't need any more money from you.
I take it you want to charter my ship.\255\003All right, that's six thousand pieces of eight.
Thanks!\255\003You've just chartered yourself a ship!
If you want to charter my ship, it'll cost you six thousand pieces of eight.
I don't recognize this at all.\255\003You'd better take it to an expert.
Thanks, I've already got some.
Thanks, but no thanks.
I have a treasure guarantee policy with all my charters.\255\003Since you came back empty-handed, we can go out again, free of charge.\255\003Just let me know if you want to go.
Let me know when you're ready to try again.
Well, congratulations on your find, Guybrush.\255\003Be sure and tell any friends you might have about Capsize Charters.\255\003See you around the turnpike.
Hmmm^  Maybe THAT'S the mail boat.
That sounds like the mail boat!\255\003I'd better fire the cannon!
That oughta do it.
Course, I don't see no mail boat^
Well, where's the mail boat?
Thought I heard it^
Was THAT it?
Uh^ Maybe?
I see.
 
Maybe later.
It's too peaceful out here for that.
I don't want to disturb the fish.
Then why don't you pipe down?
Oooh, I don't want to upset the wheel^
Not in here^\255\003The echo might kill me.
I don't want to push it.
I don't think I should use it indoors.
Au contraire!\255\003This here's an indoor-outdoor model.\255\003Suitable for even the best of my Kozy Krypts\015!
I think I've been enough of a pest.
I think I should save my breath.
Who knows what enormous deadly cave creature I'd wake up?\255\003No thanks.
Just to let LeChuck know where I am?\255\003No thanks.
I don't think I should use it indoors.
I don't think this is a good spot.\255\003Bad acoustics.
Don't even think about it.
What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
Come here often?
I can hold my breath for ten minutes!
You know, they call me the Bone Master.
You know, I could really fall for a girl like you.
What's your sign?
How'd you like to come up and see my etchings?
Wanna feel my muscles?
Has anyone ever told you you have beautiful eyes?
Wanna see my scar?
Let's get out of here and go someplace where we can talk.
If I said you had a beautiful body would you hold it against me?
Aren't you a famous model?
Wanna help me search for buried treasure?
You look like a pretty classy babe.\255\003You must be a stewardess.
You'd be in good hands with me, baby.
Trying to avoid guys like you.
Once TOO often, obviously.
You'll have to wait a lot longer than that to pick ME up.
I'm surprised anyone calls you at all.
Hopefully off a cliff.
`No trespassing.`
How'd you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?
Call me when you can find one.
Has anyone ever swallowed that line?
I've seen lobotomies, thanks.
Preferably long distance.
Just the part with the knuckles.
Aren't you a famous jerk?
How would you like to BE buried treasure?
I guess I was wrong when I thought you couldn't possibly be as dumb as you look.
You can go be in your OWN hands, creep.

Alright, settle down folks.\255\003This kid looks like a serious contender.
What's your name, boy?
\007Juicious Maximus the Third.
\007Well, they call me The Phlegm Master.
\007I am, of course, Captain Loogie.\255\009\027\000

The Phlegmster!\255\003The Phlegmalizer!\255\003The Master of Phlegm!
The Loogster!\255\003Loog-o-rama!\255\003Hockin' the big ones for fame and fortune!
Oh, no.  Dry tongue at the last minute!
Well, what about you folks?
(ahem)
Dribble Boy is back!
Juicious Maximus has returned!
The Phlegm Master, ready for his comeback!
Captain Loogie is in the house!
Spit away!
 
 
\007Swish-swish.
\007Hooooooock!
\007Chwwwwwwk!
\007Ptooie!
\007Spit?  That's gross!  I'm outta here.
Spit?  That's gross!  I'm outta here.
Misfire!  Misfire!
Everybody run!
Maybe a little over the max on the juice, there.
Well, so much for the Phlegm Master.
Gee, that's too bad, Captain.
Well, better luck next time, Dribble Boy.
Let's give him a big hand anyway, folks.
At least he tried.
He's cleared first place!
That was truly awe-inspiring!\255\003Sports fans, we've seen something incredible here today!
Let me congratulate you and give you this fine commemorative plaque.
I think you've earned the title `Phlegm Master` now.
You truly are the Master of Phlegm.
I salute you, Captain Loogie.
Way to go, Juicious.
Come on, let's give him a hand.
Of course, there are plenty more prizes for the rest of you.\255\003So how about it, gang?
What's this?  A surprise turnaround in performance?
It looks like he's rallying!
Hey, he's been working out!
Oh, and I thought he was going to go all the way.
Looks like someone stopped practicing.
Oooh, he's slipping folks.
Well, no records here.
At least he's consistent.
Once again^
Looks like second place.
Looks like third place.
That doesn't quite qualify.
^but^
I think that deserves a little applause^
Too bad there are only prizes for first place.\255\003Better luck next time.
Now, how about the rest of you?
 
 
I'm sick of that old codger and his false alarms!
Sounds like old Augustus spotted the mail boat!
Again?
False alarm.
As I was saying^
I don't want to push it.
Cheat?  With everyone watching?
I'd better not move them any farther^\255\003^these guys are dumb, but not THAT dumb.
Spitmaster
OK, now who's gonna be next?
It's a great day for spitting!
Just look at this juicy crowd!
Step up to the line and test your swill!
Valuable prizes!
Even a child can do it!\255\003In fact, they do it very well!
Come on.  It's all paid for by Booty Island Parks and Rec!
Just put your two lips together and blow!
Are you pirates or not?
Two, four, six, eight!\255\003Come on, let's expectorate!
Everybody already has the necessary equipment.
Turn a disgusting habit into a prestige-winning skill!
Don't let this grass wither up and die!
What was that?  Did I hear somebody swallow?\255\003What a waste!
Thousands will spit.  Hundreds will win!
No volunteers?  If Blackbeard were here he'd shoot you all right now.
Don't be shy!  Let it fly!
I know you want to volunteer^\255\003^it's on the tip of your tongue.
You think spitting is gross?\255\003I'll tell you what's gross--\255\003Swallowing that stuff is gross.
Prove to me that you guys are at least as fun as a pack of llamas.
I hear there are some scouts here from the pro spitting circuit^
This may be your last chance at popularity and success!
Me!  Me!
Sure looks enthusiastic about spitting.
I'm not stupid enough to fall for my own trick!
 
We're with ya, Juicious!
Alright, Phlegm-master!
C'mon, Captain Loogie!
You show 'em, Dribble Boy!
Let's go!
Spit!
Come on!
Let 'er rip!
You can do it!
Better not blow it, man.
Hey spitter hey spitter hey spitter^
You stink!
Hummm, baby!
Right on!
What are you waiting for?
I don't think he's got the lips for it.
C'mon!  What are you?  Afraid?
Shouldn't he be disqualified by now?

\007What would you trade for the map piece?
\007Can you tell me about the ship with the figurehead?
\007Please tell me about the ship with the figurehead again.
\007Nice shop you got here.
\007I have to go now.
I have to go now.
How much is it?
Visa.  Visa.  Visa.
Do you accept?
Trade for map piece?
About ship.
About ship.
The map piece is made of authentic parchment from the turn of the century.\255\003Can't find things like that anymore.
Yah, but how much is it?
About six million pieces o' eight.
Um ^ I don't think I have that much to spend.
Well ^ I do have some nice fake maps for less.
No thanks.
 
Yeah, like you have one.
But I do accept personal checks or trade-ins.
 
I'll take most old swords,\255\003some used parrots,\255\003almost anything valuable made of bronze,\255\003and a few old ship parts.
Would you give me the map piece for any of those things?
No.  But there's one thing I might trade for the map piece.
 
There was a certain ship that sunk and I'd really like the figurehead.
I'd give you the map if you got the figurehead for me.
 
The ship was a huge galleon named The Mad Monkey.\255\003Nobody knows where it sank or why.\255\003But, the figurehead is supposed to be the most fabulous piece of art ever.
That's why I want it.\255\003I'm a collector of fine art, as I'm sure you can see.
 
What a coincidence!\255\003I just so happen to have that very figurehead.
Thanks.  I pride myself on the quality of my merchandise.
I only sell the finest of pirate memorabilia.\255\003Even the trade-ins are first class.
And I always make you the best deals.
How can you afford to do that?

Guybrush
The figurehead from the Mad Monkey!
The Maaaaaad Monkey!
Ordinarily, I'd pay six million pieces o' eight for this.\255\003But I'm a bit short on the cash right now.
I'll give you this Big Whoop map piece for it.
Sure.  I'll take the map piece.
Well, well, well.\255\003I didn't think anyone would ever get the Mad Monkey's figurehead.
The Maaaaaad Monkey!
Can I get the map piece now?
Sure.
It's yours.

Dunno.
Maybe.  Maybe not.\255\003Nothing says a whale must have a name.
Don't blow a fuse.
That's a Mark VII `devastator` triple-cannon emplacement.\255\003If only they'd thought to leave a hole for the fuse.
They're great!
You'd look good in one of those.\255\003And they're great for parties.
Last noise.
I made that myself from my last parrot.\255\003Got too noisy for me.
Iron cast.
Check out these balls!\255\003They're made of a fine iron cast.
Barter.
I was told that these are used as a form of barter in the inner cities.
Every shape.
I have an eyepatch in every shape.
Third wheel.
I got that as a gift from a man I saved few years ago.\255\003Don't have much use for a wheel, but he said one good turn deserves another.
A good friend.
It was handmade by a good friend of mine from another island.
Real holy raid.
That's the real thing!\255\003As seen in `Raiders`, `Temple`, `Holy Grail`, and `The Young Chronicles`.
It's empty.
It's said that the infamous Greenbeard won that barrel from Long John Cooper in a poker game.\255\003Shame that it's empty.
Ship horn.
That's a real ship's horn just like the ones used on modern ships.
Pinhead.
It looks like Spiffy the Pinhead.
It's empty.
It's empty.
Stopping power.
It's ergomically formulated to enhance stopping power.
Holidays, smalidays.
That's a great gift for the holidays.
Sea saw.
Found that beauty at the bottom of the sea.\255\003She cleaned up real nicely though.
Never call it dead until it drops.
That's a sign I took from the famous Precipice View Road.
I've never heard of it.
They call it `Dead Man's Drop` now.
Famous pirates not for sale.
Ah, the famous ceremonial lights from the pirates of the South Pacific.\255\003Those aren't for sale.
Wenches, smenches.
It's a picture of a couple of wenches.
Pirate.
It's a picture of a pirate with peg legs.
Exactly what is it?
I'm not sure exactly what this is.
Vase.
It's a beautiful antique porcelain vase.
I'd like to buy this^\255\003^thing.
I'd like to buy these \255\006\000\064.
I'd like to buy this \255\006\000\064.
Sorry, that sign's not for sale.
Oh.
Well, ah ^
I guess I could sell it.
 
You already bought the last one I have for sale.\255\003I need to keep at least one for a display model.
Actually, those belong to my son.\255\003They aren't for sale.
I just keep those here because they're cool.\255\003They're not for sale.
I just couldn't part with those.\255\003They have sentimental value.
Yah, I like that too.\255\003But it's not for sale.
That's one of my favorite things in the store.\255\003But I don't have enough back stock to sell it.
That's great, huh?\255\003Too bad it's not for sale.
I only have one of those.\255\003So I need to keep it as a display model.
That's 6,000,000 pieces o' eight.\255\003Do you want it?
Excellent choice.
I see you have an eye for quality.
Alrighty.
Okeydokey.
Great!
And I'd like to sell you one of them.
And I'd like to sell it to you.
They're \255\004\002\064 pieces o' eight each.
That'll be \255\004\002\064 pieces o' eight.
 
I can't afford that much.
Too bad.
If you really want it, I could buy back some of the stuff you bought from me.
 
\007OK.  I'll take it.
\007On second thought, I'd better save my money.
Your loss.
It's yours.
Let me get you one from overstock.
Here you go.
Thank you.
How much will you give me for this plaque?
I'm not interested.
 
\007What do you mean?  It's worth a mint!
\007You'd be interested if you knew how valuable it was.
\007OK, but you're missing a great deal here.
For a lump of pus on a shingle?
 
\007That's not just any lump of pus.
\007It's better than most of the junk in here.
\007Fine.  Your loss, buddy.
Oh yeah?\255\003What's so special about it?
\007The spit of the person who killed LeChuck is on it.
\007It's made out of rare, ecologically safe materials.
\007Actually, it's so valuable, I'd better keep it.
Really?!\255\003That would make it very valuable.\255\003And I do like bronze, anyway.
I'll give you 6000 pieces o' eight for it.
It's a deal.
 
Uh-huh.
Can I sell back these \255\006\000\064?
Can I sell back this \255\006\000\064?
Sure.
Heck, I'll even give you back what you paid for them.
Heck, I'll even give you back what you paid for it.
Thanks.
Well, I was feeling guilty about how much I charged you anyway.
Hey, I'm a fair guy.
Call me soft hearted.
After all, this ain't Stan's.
We aim to please.
No one leaves here unsatisfied.
Hey!\255\003Take that thing outside, will ya?

Leave me alone.  I saw that already.
Sorry, no returns.
No, thank you.
I don't want to pin him.
Excuse me^
You can pick up your costume anytime.
Hope you're enjoying your costume.
\007I'd like to rent a costume.
\007I'd really like to rent a costume.
\007I'd really REALLY like to rent a costume.
\007I NEED to rent a costume.
\007I HAVE TO rent a costume.
\007My life depends on renting a costume.
\007Did I ask you about renting a costume yet?
\007Um, I'm looking for a costume.
\007PLEASE rent me a costume.
\007But you have tons of costumes.
\007Why are your costumes so popular?
\007You look busy.  I'll come back later.
Our costumes are all gone or on reserve.
I hear there're invitations available in the gambling alley on Phatt Island.\255\003One reserved costume per invitation.
Sorry.
Try us after Mardi Gras.
Or get an invitation at the casino on Phatt Island.
Look.  If you don't have a reservation, you don't have a costume.
I said, I'm all out.
I told you, we don't have any more costumes.
Can't you see I'm busy?
Sorry, can't help you.
Next time make a reservation.
I don't have a costume for you.
 
They're all reserved and waiting to be picked up.
 
I'm the only costume shop in a five-island radius.
And besides, everybody who's anybody is going to the big Mardi Gras celebration at Governor Marley's mansion.
 
Ah, you have a costume on reserve!
Well, that's a different story!
Let's see^
Your costume is right over here^
Walk this way, please.
Well, here it is.\255\003You'll surely be the talk of the party in this.
Well, have fun and enjoy your costume.
 
This is really nice.
Neat.
I like this one.
Great costume.
I had one like that when I was a kid.
I think this one's my favorite.
I wonder if I can rent this one.
Spacious.
I'm not ready for that yet.
Hey, take your time.  No hurry.

It's nailed shut!
I almost forgot.\255\003I wanted you to have this complimentary hankie.
Just my way of saying, `I care.`
Now, where were we?\255\003Oh yeah.
Sure, sure.  Try out the lid operation.\255\003It's just as roomy closed.
HOWDY!!!
Welcome to Stan's Previously Owned Coffins!\255\003We handle the dead for a lot less bread.
What are you looking for, son?
Need a bin for your next of kin?
Want a family plot without spending a lot?
You're in luck!
Just look at all this quality merchandise!
Never before touched by a living soul.
Most of it used only for a few hours^
^premature burial, you know.  That sort of thing.
Well, speak up.  Or are you dead?\255\003Either way, you came to the right place.
Well, well, well.\255\003I knew you'd come back.
My customers always do.\255\003^EVENTUALLY.
Hey, welcome back!
 
 
\007Could you show me that coffin again?\255\009\026\000
\007How much is that coffin?\255\009\026\000
\007I'm looking for a good used coffin.
\007Actually, I'd just like to browse.
\007Didn't you used to be a used-ship salesman?\255\009\023\000
\007Do you do funerals?
\007I'm not actually in the market for a coffin yet.
\007I need to get something embalmed.
\007I gotta go.  See you later.\255\009\026\000
Amazing!\255\003When you first walked in here I said, `Now THERE'S a guy who needs a good used coffin!`
There happens to be an excellent deal right behind you.
Let's go take a look-see.
Now this here^
^is the Cadillac of Coffins.
Look at all that leg room!
There's room in there for Long John Silver himself!
Here--let me get in and show you.
Now this isn't just your average sixty-gallon coffin.\255\003This has the full seventy-five gallons you need to avoid unsightly bone readjustments.
Good solid construction on this baby.\255\003`It keeps out the worms\255\001While your body firms.`
I have to warn you, I've got five other dead guys coming to look at this today.
Have you decided to buy?
Could you get in and show me how big it is again?
 
Can I show you anything else?
Well, it's complicated^\255\003Pricing here at Stan's works on a sliding scale^\255\003^based on one's ability to pay^
^so as to make a decent funeral affordable to even our poorest customers.
That's very considerate of you.
So, how much dough do you have on you?
I have \255\004\049\001 pieces of eight.
Oooh, that hurts.\255\003They JUST raised the casket tax.\255\003Now that baby's going for \255\004\228\001 pieces of eight.
Actually, I'm one of those poor customers you were talking about.
I see.\255\003I think cremation might be more appropriate in this instance.
Of course we do funerals!\255\003And not just those somber, all-black, three-handkerchief affairs^
We do it in a rowdy Mardi Gras style, with music and dancing and pallbearer races^
I like to say we put the FUN in FUNerals.\255\003Heh heh.
Well, you came to the right place!\255\003`Your loved ones deserve\255\001Stan's special preserve.`
`You won't smell a whiff\255\001When we're done with your stiff.`
I never knew morticians were so clever.\255\009\025\000
Sorry^\255\003Health regulations prohibit me from allowing uncertified persons free access to used internment paraphernalia.
Aw, shucks.
It's never too early to make funeral arangements.\255\003Making plot reservations now insures you a space at our popular Scabb Island Internment Park\015^
^as well as entitling you to discounts on park rentals.
Rentals?
You know--for barbecues, parties--that sort of thing.
Well, yeah.\255\003But I decided to get into a business where unsatisfied customers are less likely to come back and complain.
Here, take this complimentary hankie.
Just my way of saying, `I care.`
 
Maybe sooner than you think.
 
Yes, a man can really rest in peace AND comfort with one of these.
Why should a man's coffin be any smaller than his bunk at sea?
I could spend a lot of time in a coffin like this.
Look at how freely I can wiggle my toes.
This thing's bigger than my kitchen!
You know, a person's coffin should reflect their station in life.
If you're thinking about one of those cheaper models, first ask yourself,\255\003`Isn't my loved one worth the best?`
This is truly the casket of captains.
When you've spent your life on something as big as the ocean,\255\003how can you spend your death in anything smaller?
There's enough room in here for a pirate AND his parrot.
Feel free to join me.  There's room for both of us!
I could just stay in here all day.
If you should ever need to turn in your grave^\255\003^you could in here with comfort and ease.
Even though it is used, you'll notice it still has that new coffin smell.
I don't mean to scare you, but anything smaller than this and we might have to cut off your loved one's feet.
Take it from me, I'm as claustrophobic as they come, and I love it in here.
This baby's so nice, it should be illegal--\255\003It makes people want to die.
I've got one of these in the back for when I go.
Just take a look at this convenient beverage holder.
We also stock an excellent worm repellent that I might just throw in for free.
You gotta admit, it's cozy.\255\003Do I not look cozy in here?
It's already nailed shut.
But I don't have a hammer.
But I don't have any nails.
But it's open.
It's just as roomy closed.\255\003Here, let me show you^
See?
I hear you knocking up there.\255\003That's solid oak you're hearing!
Yes it sure is nice in here.
Hey!  I think the lid's stuck!
Uh^  Excuse me, friend^\255\003Could you see if the clasp is closed on this thing?\255\003I seem to be stuck^
Hello?
Is there anybody out there?
Yoo-hoo?
Help!
I can't get out of here!
OK, a joke's a joke, now GET ME OUT OF HERE!
Open this coffin right now!
Anybody?
I really am claustrophobic.
Someone's going to pay for this.
I'd bust out of here, but the dang thing's built too well.
Well, if I had to be stuck in a coffin, at least it's the deluxe model.
It really is pretty roomy in here.
Maybe I'll take a nap.
I hope this thing's not airtight.
I'm not dead!
I'm losing valuable business.
Let me out!  I need to go to the bathroom.
Hey, kid.  Don't be touching that.
Sure!
Okeydokey!
Alrighty^
Yessiree!
Heck, why not?
No problemo!
What an excellent idea!
I was just going to suggest that myself.
Of course!
Hey, anything you say!
Dang.  Looks like it's empty.
Of course it is!\255\003I just went to the bank!\255\003Now get me out of here!
 
Nothing inside.

\007What are you guarding here?

\007Elaine Marley?  From M\136l\130e Island?
\007Gotta go.  Keep up the good work.\255\009\026\000
Elaine Marley, of course.
 
Yup.  The same heroic Elaine Marley who killed the Ghost Pirate LeChuck.
But, I killed LeChuck!\255\009\027\000
Why would Governor Marley lie?
\007Jealousy?\255\009\006\000
\007Revenge?\255\009\006\000
\007Fame and fortune?\255\009\006\000
\007For attention?\255\009\006\000
In your dreams.
 
I'm guarding Governor Marley's mansion.
 
Thanks.
Where's your costume for the Governor's party?
 
Governor Marley is having a huge Mardi Gras party.
Invitation only^ costumes required^ that sort of thing.
 
You mean Governor Marley's Mardi Gras fish fry?
It's invitation only and costumes are required.
 
Did you bring a costume and invitation?

\007Uh, I didn't want to go anyway.
Suit yourself.
Well, what do you know?\255\003You do have an invitation.
 
Do you have a costume?
Then you can't go past me.
 
Nobody would willingly wear such a dopey costume.
 
Better put it on.
Well, if you insist.\255\003But you'll have to try to restrain yourself.
No, no!  Not here!
Go in the bushes or something.

Oh, that is nice.

\007LeChuck's alive and I'm on the lam!
\007This crazy mutt is trying to kill me!
\007How did you know my name?
I was talking to the dog.
Who are you?
\007She named her DOG Guybrush?
\007Mr. Threepwood.  Take me to the Governor right away.
\007I'm Governor Marley's ex-boyfriend.  She's expecting me.
\007I'm selling these fine pink dresses.
\007I'm here for the party.  Want to see my invitation?
Yeah, I don't get it either.\255\003It's not much of name if you ask me.
She says it's cause he's dumb and helpless and keeps getting in the way.
But he sure can sniff out the Governor's possessions.
Maybe you should empty your pockets.
I was just about to suggest the very same thing.
But first, why don't you empty your pockets?
Sure, sure, loverboy.\255\003I'll just take you right up to see her.
No thanks.  It's not on my color wheel.
But let's just see what you have in your pockets.
That's a good idea.
While you're at it, why don't you show me everything you have in your pockets?
Try and catch me, old man!
Oh, look out for that rake.

Don't let me catch you hanging around the Governor's party, either.

OK, that's it.  I'm calling the cops!

You'd better go before I lose my temper.

I'm gonna sweat off twenty pounds in this stupid costume!
No kidding.\255\003I forgot to put airholes in mine.
Why do we put up with this stuff?
I dunno.
I guess to prove we're fun-loving guys?
You check out the spitting contest?
Yeah.  Got second place.
Not bad!
Yeah, well, you know.\255\003The wind was with me.
Nice mask.
Thanks.
More subtle than most.
Yes, thanks.
Not your usual, larger-than-life,\255\003Mardi Gras head.
Nope.
Probably saved a lot on materials, huh?
I'm sure I don't know.
Not that paper mache is very expensive^
Do you mean `Papier-M\131ch\130?`
Yeah, whatever.
No, I don't imagine that it's very expensive at all.
Still, you must have saved a bundle.
I never scrimp when it comes to the holidays.
Well, I didn't mean you were cheap^
Parties and balls are my life.
I just meant^
Making gay is the only purpose I can find in my wretched, well-to-do life.
I'm sure it must be hard--
But you say my costume looks cheap.
No, no.  It looks great!
That's not what you said before.
I just said it looked^ subtle.
Can't we just drop the subject?
Yeah.  OK.  Fine.

To moderate, social drinking!
Moderation in all things, yes.
So where are all the chicks?
Yeah.  I thought there'd be some here.
Then again^\255\003^in these costumes, who can tell?
That's true.\255\003There might be some babes here.
But what can we do about it?
Well^  we just ask.
Ask?\255\003What are you, nuts?
Yeah.  I guess you're right.
Sigh.
Mardi Gras sure is tough on us swingers.
I'll drink to that.
Some party, eh?
Yep.
Try the fish?
Yeah.  Almost choked on a bone.
Hear the one about the Polar Bear with the hairlip?
Yeah.  Last week.
Yeah, well.  You know.
Yeah.
How's work?
Same old, same old.
Like the music?
It's alright.
Where'd you get the costume?
Ah, I wore it last year.
Can I get you a refill?
Nyah.  I'm fine.
Pretty good turn out.
Yep.
Heard any new jokes?
Not in months.
Gotta get the recipe for that fish.
Oh, yeah.

Where'd you get that drink?\255\009\007\000
So how do you know Elaine?
Anyone seen the Governor?
Tried the fish?
This is some house, wouldn't you say?
So, when do we bob for apples?\255\009\006\000
Say, did you make that costume yourself?\255\009\007\000
Hey!  Let's form a bunny hop line!
Well, it's been nice talking to you.\255\003Gotta go now.\255\009\026\000

What did you say your name was?\255\009\023\000

This is fun.\255\003We should all do this more often, don't you think?
So are you wearing anything under there?\255\009\024\000
Man, she has shoulder pads in everything.
I think I'm wearing enough women's clothes right now.
I'm warm enough in the one I have on.

The one and only, sugarbear!

Don't talk to me.
Snugglepuss!

I'm warning you^
Pooper-dooper!
Maybe I should go rake the back forty.
Look at us, together again.
Boy.  We haven't been like this since^\255\003^well^
Since I quit my job and moved away without leaving a forwarding address?
Was that what happened?  Gee, I thought^
Guybrush!  Can't you take a hint?
We were a mistake!
I thought we had an agreement.
Maybe I wasn't clear enough the last time^
Boy, you really can't take a hint.
Aren't you supposed to be history?
Don't you ever give up?
Why can't you just leave me alone?
I thought I smelled something.
 
 
Guybrush's score: \255\004\055\001 out of 50.
Oh, Guybrush^
I know I shouldn't have anything to do with you^
^but there's something about your weakness and ineptitude that I find infectious.
Does that mean you're going to let me have the map?
The map!\255\003Is that what this is all about?
I should have known better!
If the map's all you care about^
^you'd better go out and get it.
That's it!\255\003I've had enough.
Get your mangy hide outta my house.
OK, that's enough!
Get out of here!
That's the last straw!
Beat it or be sorry.
I can't take it anymore!
Hit the road!
You have three seconds to leave my room.
One^\255\003Two^\255\003Three^
\007I've decided to let you come back to me.
\007I'm waiting for your apology.
\007Is it my imagination, or have you gained weight?
\007I came all this way to see you--at least get me a beer.
\007Great to see you again.  Is there any food in this dump?
\007Gosh you're cute when you're pretending to be mad.
\007Your lonely nights are over, baby.  I have returned.
\007How's your sister?  The REALLY good-looking one?
\007You know, I kinda liked your old house better.
\007So tell me^ You and the gardener?  Eh?
\007Still not afraid to use a lot of perfume, I see.
\007What I really could use now is a grade-A footrub.
\007Why don't you slip into something more comfortable?
\007Still ignoring fashion, eh?  Good for you.
\007I got a feeling someone needs a big, sloppy kiss.
\007So, who's the father?
\007Why don't you just give me that map like a good girl?
\007Better give me that map.  Treasure huntin's men's work.
\007Elaine, take me back.  I can't live without you.
\007Won't you at least give me a second chance?
\007I realize now what a fool I've been.
\007My life's been meaningless without you.
\007If I can't be with you, I don't want to live.
\007Life without you is an endless nightmare.
\007You were right.  I was a buffoon.  And a weenie.
\007Have pity on my poor, broken soul.
\007Can't you see how my heart has suffered?
\007Elaine, save me from this whirlpool of misery.
\007I'd jump out that window to prove my love.
\007May lightning strike me if I bear false intentions!
\007I'll win you back, if it's the last thing I do!
\007My soul is sick, Elaine, and love is the only cure.
\007If you won't take me back, just kill me now.
\007Please baby please baby please baby please baby please.
\007Maybe we should talk about this.
\007Don't you like my new beard?\255\009\024\000
\007Those other women meant nothing to me.
\007LeChuck's alive, and I need your help to fight him.
\007I'm not sure, but don't you owe me some money?\255\009\025\000
\007Come on.  Let me buy you a grog.
\007I stopped doing that knuckle-cracking thing.
\007I should warn you--I cancelled the boat insurance.
\007Do you have my red sweater?  I can't find it anywhere.
\007I like what you've done with your hair.
\007Is that a new blouse?
\007Real scorcher outside, eh?
\007Have you been forwarding all my mail?
\007That's some party downstairs^\255\009\026\000
\007You're the Governor of my heart, baby.
\007Fine.  Be that way.  There are other fish in the sea.
Oh really?
I guess that's supposed to make up for everything?
Nice try, but I think you're too late.
Decide to act civilized for a change, eh?
Oh, so now you're a good guy?
You should have thought of that sooner.
Do you really think you can get on my good side now?
So much for a pleasant attitude.
And here I thought you were becoming a decent guy.
Ooooh, it's going to be that way, is it?
There goes any hope for a pleasant conversation.
This is getting ugly.
I should have known you weren't sincere.
You're getting warmer^
Well, that's not the MOST stupid thing you've ever said.
That's a LITTLE better^
Hmmm^  keep going.
Close.  You're getting close.
Pathetic.
Do you really expect me to fall for that?
Oh, please.
Is that supposed to make me swoon?
Yeah, right.
Give me a break, will ya?
Uh-huh.  Sure.
What book did you steal that out of?
You've been watching too much daytime television.
Oh, gag me.
That may work on other women, but not me.
Really, I'm touched\255\003^NOT!
That's sweet.\255\003Now scram.
What a line!
I can't believe it--you're even more of a weenie than before.
You're going to have to try a little harder than that.
I'm warning you--you're getting on my nerves.
OK, you're really pushing it now, buddy.
You're this close to getting a sock in the jaw.
One more crack like that and you'll be bouncing down those stairs.
You're on the verge of hospitalization, Guy.
I see you're charming as ever.
Now that wasn't very pleasant.
Maybe you'd better leave.
I can't believe I actually thought I missed you.
This is beneath even you, Guybrush.
You've got a lot of nerve, coming in here and saying that.
I oughtta just punch you out.
One thing's for sure--you haven't gotten any better at talking to women.
I hope that was a joke.
Same old Guybrush.
Can't you take a hint?
Sorry, Threep.  I don't play those games anymore.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, right.
You know, I do have work to do^
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Give me a break.
Spare me.
Go tell it to your mamma.
Give it up, Brush.
 
Yeah, but even fish have standards.
Good riddance.
Finally!
Well, thanks for stopping by and ruining my day.
Don't bother my guests on the way out.
Wish I could say it's been nice.
You'll be back^\255\003^unfortunately.
Get lost.
I was just about to say the same thing.
I was wondering when you'd catch a clue.
You're going?\255\003But I was just getting used to the smell.
She's gone.\255\003I guess I really made her mad this time.
 
It sure is big.
It's slimy and squishy.

Well^ yes sir, but^\255\003What good can a chest full of money do him?
It is not the treasure that is important.\255\009\007\000\255\003It is what is buried beneath the treasure that concerns me.\255\003He must not find the treasure of Big Whoop.\255\003See to it.\255\009\006\000
Yes sir.

Ah^\255\003LeChuck sir^\255\003I regret to report that Guybrush has found one of the map pieces to Big Whoop.
You will regret a lot more if he finds another.\255\009\006\000\255\003Stop him at any cost^\255\003But remember^\255\003I want him alive.\255\009\006\000

Very good.
Do you have anything else to report?\255\009\007\000
Ah^
No^
Well^
There is one other small little thing.
I assume this has to do with Guybrush's capture?
Well^\255\003Sort of^
You've allowed him find the second map piece, haven't you!!\255\009\006\000

The bad news is that Guybrush has found the last piece of the map.
Ah^\255\003The good news is that I've got a plan that can't fail.
Ah^\255\003You see^\255\003He must take the map to a cartographer to have it deciphered.\255\003I'll head him off before he gets there.

Yes I have.  Thanks for noticing.
What?\255\003You can't leave me in here!
 
\007The map, Wally!  What about the map?
\007I have something to confess about your monocle.
\007OK, stand back.  I'm going to bust down the door.
\007Could you please stop that annoying swinging?
\007I'm going to go get that key!
\007I'm going to go have a look around.  Sit tight.

Oh, LeChuck's got it, but who cares?
Who cares?!?
Yeah, I memorized the whole thing before he took it.\255\003It's on an island called Dinky, not too far from here.
After you bust me out of here, we could steal a boat and go there!
Sorry.
Dread stole it.
I knew it!\255\003He always envied my intellectual look.
What, are you nuts?\255\003Go get the key.
He probably keeps it in his office down the hall.

\007Hi, Herman.
\007Herman Toothrot!  What are you doing here?
\007Word up, Herman.
Oh, hi.
I've been waiting for you.
\007What do you mean you've been waiting for me?
\007What are you doing here?
\007I think I have an answer to the philosophical puzzle you \254\008     posed for me.
\007Could you teach me some philosophy?
\007I'm looking for a treasure.  Have you seen any?
\007I think I have better things to do than talk to you.
Our meeting comes at this, the final moment of my existence so far.\255\003All else has been in anticipation of this event.
I think you will find that the concept of 'better things' is the frailest of illusions.
\007Do you always say things like that?
\007Do you mean to tell me that your WHOLE LIFE has been \254\008     merely a prelude to meeting me here today?
\007What happens now that I'm here?
\007You're weirding me out, I gotta go.
Nothing I say is ever the same, yet it is all said the same way.
Yours too.\255\003But see, already the moment passes.
Now our meeting is nothing more than another note in the grand overture to the next passage.
The moment has passed, and we face the future.
As you wish.\255\003You will return.
There are many treasures here, found and unfound.\255\003The beauty of the ocean, for example.
\007I was thinking more along the lines of monetary gain.
\007Actually, I'm looking for the treasure of Big Whoop.
\007Yes, that's quite true.
                 
Or the treasure of the past, seen in the rings of trees or the half-remembered cacklings of a parrot^
\007Yes, I see.
                 
^the treasure of the future, waiting in the seeds of mangoes and the eggs of the platypus^
\007Yeah, I get the point.
                 
^dreams that bring us messages from afar which we are too simple to understand, and stars that do the same^
\007Alright already!
                 
^and may not riches be found in the words of one who has explored the veiled inner worlds of the self?
Speaking of which, I am taking on students for a limited time.
Money is seldom a treasure, my friend.
Big Whoop?\255\003I'm afraid I'm not familiar with that one.
^and of course there's the treasure of patience^
I'm teaching philosophy here.
\007Right here, on the beach?
\007What sort of philosophy are you teaching?
\007How many students have you got?
\007That's nice, but I think I'd best be off now.
Sure beats a Tibetan mountaintop.\255\003I can go surfing when things are slow.
Neo-existentialist Cartesian Zen Taoism.\255\003It's all the rage at cocktail parties this year.
Well^\255\003^none, at the moment.\255\003But as soon as word gets out that a guru such as myself is teaching in a beautiful locale like this^\255\003^I'll have to beat them off with a stick.
Just let me know if you want to learn a little philosophy.
OK, here's a Zen koan for you.

Boo!

Hello, Guybrush.
\007Hello, LeChuck.
\007Goodbye, LeChuck.
\007Would you mind not spitting so much when you talk?
You won't escape me this time!
\007Yeah?  Just watch me!
\007I escaped from you before, I can easily do it again.
\007Oh?  Why do you say that?
\007You're right, I give up.
Not so fast!
That's just as well.
Even if you were to escape, I would always be able to find you again.\255\003We are bound to one another.
\007Like soup and salad?
\007Like life and limb?
\007Like dreadlocks?
Not really.\255\003More like^
How appropriate.\255\003But I meant more like^
Yes, rather like that.\255\003Or like^
^brothers!
Eh?
I--\255\003--am your brother!
No!\255\003No, that's not true!\255\003That's impossible!
Search your feelings, you KNOW it to be true!
Noooooooo!!!!
^and I've brought a little surprise for you!
\007I think you being my brother is enough of a surprise \254\008    for one day.
\007Really?  A treat?
\007Am I going to enjoy this?
\007I don't suppose it's a Nintendo\015 game^
Perhaps, but humor me.
A treat for ME, a surprise for YOU.
No, but I will.
No^
\007A dolly?  The surprise is a dolly?
\007What's with the big, sharp, deadly looking pin?
\007Is this going to be anything like `pin the tail \254\008    on the donkey?`
\007Say, that wouldn't happen to be a voodoo doll, would it?
The surprise is a VOODOO dolly^
It's an accessory for this voodoo doll^
Something like that.\255\003This is a voodoo doll^
Why yes, as a matter of fact it IS a voodoo doll^
^which I'll be using to torture you^
^and then send you screaming to another dimension, one of infinite pain!
Observe^
\007I'll do anything, just please don't do that again!\255\009\007\000
\007Are you quite finished?
\007Mama!
OK, how about this:
No, I want to do this:
Heh heh heh.
That was exhilarating!\255\003Let's have some more fun, shall we?
Please!\255\003No more!
OK, time to send you screaming to a dimension of infinite pain!
Aaaiiiiieeee!!!!
At last, I'm rid of that pesky little wimp Guybrush!
WHUMP!
Hey, I'm alive!
Eh?
I thought I was a goner!
Whoops^
Strange^\255\003There must be something wrong with my voodoo doll.
It was supposed to send you to another dimension, not the next room.
Shoddy materials, I'll bet.
Well, I guess I'll just try it again.
Uh, no, that's OK, I--
Take this, BROTHER.
Hey, nothing's happening!
Root beer only works on ghosts, Guybrush.\255\003Having been resurrected, I'm not a ghost anymore.\255\003Allow me to demonstrate.
Here, try this.
Now, isn't that better?

Aha!\255\003Caught you!

That's pretty good, Guybrush^\255\003^but not good enough to stop ME!

Eh?
Oh, it's you.
What, THAT again?\255\003Ooh, look at me quakin' in me booties.\255\003I laugh at you and your puny voodoo tinkerings.\255\003Hah!
\007Take THIS, LeChuck!
\007Take THAT, LeChuck!
\007You know, this doll reminds me of the Stretchy \254\008    Strongman\015 I had as a kid.
\007I wonder what would happen if I tore the leg \254\008    off this thing?
Come on!
You don't scare me!
You think you're so big?
Stab the doll again!
It doesn't hurt!
I can take it!
I'm not afraid of your doll!
What are you gonna do now?
I'm gonna kick your butt, what do you think about that?
I'm much too powerful for you and your puny doll!
You'll have to do better than that!
Is that the best you can do?
You always were a wimp.
Ha!

But I want you to--\255\003--gag--\255\003--take my mask off^\255\003^choke^\255\003^see the TRUE face of your brother^
\007Forget it, I'm not coming over there.
\007No chance, you'll just rip out my lungs when I get close.
\007Leg or no leg, I trust you about as far as I can throw \254\008     Manhattan.
\007Oh, all right, I'm coming over.
But you've got to see--\255\003--hack--\255\003--my TRUE face!
--gurgle--\255\003No, no, I promise!\255\003Please, come take off the--\255\003--argh--\255\003--the mask!

Gently now, remove my--\255\003--hack--\255\003--mask.
My god, you're^\255\003^my creepy brother Chuckie.
What, did you think I was kidding before?
\007Why have you been chasing me all over the place?
\007When our mother told you to hunt me down, did she \254\008     actually mention KILLING me, or was that your idea?
\007How come you hate me as much as you obviously do?
\007Do you really think a truck is more \254\008     important than your own BROTHER?
Our mother told me to hunt you down.
Get outta town!
Well, you remember the time you broke my Junior Ultra Soldier Commando Assault Vehicle\015?
No.
It wasn't a truck, it was a Junior Ultra Soldier Commando Assault Vehicle\015.
Look, Guybrush, could you help me out?\255\003Stick the leg back on the doll, OK?
\007Will you promise to stop picking on me?
\007Will you promise not to hold me down and spit on me \254\008     anymore?
\007Will you promise to stop locking me in your footlocker?
All right, all right, I promise!\255\003Anything, just put my leg back on!
Hey, you kids!\255\003You're not supposed to be in here!
Ah, so there you are!
\007What's going on?
\007Who are you people?
\007What IS this place?
We're scolding you for running off.\255\003Your mother and I were very concerned.
Just the same old family you've always had.
Well, it's not the Screaming Weenie Hut where we told you to meet us.\255\003Your mother and I were very concerned.
Thank you for hunting down your brother like we asked, Chuckie dear.
You boys didn't get in any trouble, now, did you?
\007No, sir.
\007Chuckie tried to kill me!
\007I stole a bunch of stuff and caused two huge explosions.
No, sir.\254\001\255\002
         No, sir.
Good.
I wish you wouldn't run off like that, young man.\255\003We were worried sick.
You don't know what kinds of murderers and white slavers might be hanging around a place like this.
\007Yes, mom.
\007OK, mom.
\007I'm Guybrush Threepwood, a mighty pirate.  I don't have \254\008     to worry about stuff like that.
\007This is weird.  What's going on here?
Of course, dear.\255\003But please be careful.
Well, come on then, let's go ride the Madly Rotating Buccaneer.
