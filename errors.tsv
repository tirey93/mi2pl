393	Hi. I'm Guybrush Threepwood, LeChuck-busting stud.
404	Nobody sent me. I'm free-lance.
405	I was sent by the I.R.S.  Let me see your files.
406	Don't shoot! I was just asking.
407	Well, well. Aren't we jumpy?
415	Are you looking for Big Whoop, too?
418	I'm looking for Big Whoop myself. Wanna help?
451	Wow. That's some story.
465	Hey! I did it! Largo LaGrande left Scabb!
474	Is longitude the sideways one, or is that latitude?

814	It's a story of the Ghost Pirate LeChuck and his gruesome demise--
861	A little.
863	Are you saying there's an opening in the kitchen?
866	No thanks. I like being my own boss.
867	I dunno. How much does it pay?
868	Can I have some time to think about it?
887	I went out for a swim.

1312	I'm Guybrush.  You tried to sell me the minutes of a PTA meeting in the last game, claiming it was a map.
1348	I think you're overlooking the potential symbolism to be gained by your closeness to the earth.
1378	Give me money for the polish.
1421	That you should bore passers-by to tears with long stories?
1453	Pretty please with sugar, nuts, a cherry, and chocolate sprinkles?

2289	That's right.  I'm the man who swashed the Ghost Pirate LeChuck's buckles.
2291	No, my name is Smith.  You must have me confused with someone else.

7628	I think I have an answer to the philosophical puzzle you posed for me.
7636	Do you mean to tell me that your WHOLE LIFE has been merely a prelude to meeting me here today?
7729	Macintosh Red?
7800	I'd better get over there.
7914	Now you're in for it...
7915	you bilious bag of barnacle bait!

7918	Than a scab on a pirate.

7920	Are you my mother?

7923	Oh, there's a monkey in my pocket,
7924	And he's stealing all my change,
7925	His stare is blank and glassy, I suspect that he's deranged...
7926	Now you're in for it...
7927	you bilious bag of barnacle bait!

7986	Cool, an arcade token!
7988	Yeow!
7989	Boy, that look comfy!
8069	You know, this doll reminds me of the Stretchy Muscleman I had as a kid.
8070	I wonder what would happen if I tore the leg off this thing?
8097	No chance, you'll just rip my lungs out when I get close.
8098	Leg or no leg, I trust you about as far as I can throw Manhattan.
8119	When our mother told you to hunt me down, did she actually mention KILLING me, or was that your idea?
8121	Do you really think a truck is more important than your own BROTHER?
8124	Well, you remember the time you broke my Junior Ultra Soldier Commando Assault Vehicle?
8126	It wasn't a truck, it was a Junior Ultra Soldier Commando Assault Vehicle.
8130	Will you promise not to hold me down and spit on me anymore?
8155	You don't know what kinds of murderers and ne'er do wells might be hanging around a place like this.
8158	I'm Guybrush Threepwood, a mighty pirate.  I don't have to worry about stuff like that.
8201	Huh?
8209	...and I brought a little surprise for you!
8210	I think you being my brother is enough of a surprise for one day.
8213	I don't suppose it's a LucasArts0x99 game...
8220	Is this going to be anything like `pin the tail on the donkey`?
8230	I'll do anything, just please don't do that again!

8396	Deep in the Caribbean \n Scabb Island
8400	Ron: My name's Ron Gilbert and I did pretty much everything on this game. I did all the art, the music, programming and the writing.
8401	Tim: So typical.0x0ADave: I'm Dave Grossman; I helped Ron do everything on this game.
8402	Dave: I helped to design puzzles and wrote lots of dialogue and programmed things and made little people walk around and created scenes.
8403	Tim: My name's Tim Schafer, I helped get coffee for these guys. And then at night, I redid everything that they did.
8404	And I was an assistant designer-programmer, that's the official title.0x0ARon: That was part of the official title.
8405	Tim: Yeah. So we helped with puzzles and then wrote dialogue and then programmed.0x0AWow, we used to program.
8406	Ron: Mm hmm. I still program too.0x0ATim: What's happening?
8407	Dave: What was that sound?0x0ATim: Oh my god the game's starting! What an awesome game!
8408	Tim: Oh, we're going into Woodtick. Don't go on that bridge, there's a... don't!
8409	Dave: I always liked this bit because the player always feels like they've done something wrong.
8410	Ron: Right, without knowing it.0x0ADave: Yeah. People would actually go back and try and play this again, to try
8411	and not get caught by him on the bridge.0x0ARon: Yeah, Largo LaGrande is named after where I grew up.
8412	Tim: Largo? Key Largo?0x0ARon: Nah, I grew up in Le Grande Oregon, so that's where I, or we, got his name.
8413	Dave: Where did the Largo come from?0x0ARon: I don't know. That's how they used to call him back there.
8414	Dave: They used to call him Largo?0x0ATim: That was his nickname, "Hey Largo."
8415	Ron: Largo from Le Grande.0x0ATim: Is that Bogart, Key Largo?
8416	Ron: I always liked how he started out with a whole bunch of money so you kinda thought he had a bunch of stuff, and then it all like, completely goes away
8417	at the very beginning of the game.0x0ATim: Yeah, that fit in with our running theme of mean, cruel things that we enjoyed.
8418	Give a player a bunch of money, and then take it away from them.0x0ARon: And then just take it all away from them immediately, yup.
8419	Tim: I just wanna say how good looking Guybrush's hair is looking, in this game.0x0AHe has a new stylist in this game. But his eyes are in the... ok sorry.
8420	Dave: Wasn't the money thing inspired by just how much time you spent in the first game having to get money, like it was a really big thing.
8421	Like, "Oh, you didn't have any money and you had to go to the circus and get a job and all that". It's like, this time; let's start them off with TONS of money.
8422	Ron: More money than I know what to do. And then we're gonna take it all away.
8423	Tim: OK, here is the big premier of iMUSE. Right? 0x0ARon: Yes.
8424	Tim: This is the biggest, and I think the biggest ever, most complicated piece of iMUSE music that was ever made.
8425	Ron: We had like, two, like, full time programmers who were doing nothing but programming the iMUSE transitions.
8426	Tim: Cause like, it's a main theme outside and then every time you go into one of these inner locations, or inside the house, it would...
8427	...enable or disable instruments and it would change the theme a little bit.0x0ARon: Right. Right. Yeah I know, iMUSE was like, absolutely amazing.
8428	Tim: But, they put a lot of work into it and they decided never to do it again. They were like, no one noticed! I noticed.
8429	Ron: I did!
8430	Tim: I think, this may be controversial too, but I think that the Special Edition for...
8431	...Monkey 2 is an improvement, like, as an old... Like, playing... I'm very nostalgic when I play the Special Edition for Monkey 1.
8432	I was kinda like, the old art is so charming, I always play it in the old art. The new art was really pretty but I was really drawn... But, Monkey 2...
8433	...I'm not saying that Monkey 2 looked bad, but we were just starting to use the scanner and so we hadn't cleaned up much stuff.
8434	So it's actually really nice to see it switch into that cleaned up view, because I 0x0Athink, you know, in later games we would take all those stray pixels out and...
8435	Ron: Just smooth it all out.0x0ATim:...smooth it all out, yeah.
8436	Ron: I think some of that's an artifact of the markers, because you know, Peter Chan did everything with those markers.
8437	Ron: It's all done with the markers, think that's a little of an artifact of that.0x0ATim: That's my rounded way, roundabout compliment of the Monkey 2 Special Edition.
8438	Tim: Largo reminds me of someone from like, old, like, Bowery Boys movies. You know what I mean? Bowery Boys.
8439	Tim: Or Squiggy, from Laverne and Shirley. Oh my god! I just realized that's where I stole the intro to Full Throttle, like I pull... that's embarrassing...
8440	...where he pulls his nose down to the bar, it's totally, ugh... how embarrassing... 0x0AI totally stole that whole quohog thing from Monkey 2.
8441	Ron: Just also a lot of foreshadowing with the spitting, and the spitting contest... and all of those things in there.
8442	Tim: Where's the spittoon? Oh no, there's spit over there on the left hand side.0x0ADave: Oh yeah.
8443	Tim: Did we do a close up of the spit flying, or did we cut that?0x0ARon: No that was there.
8444	Tim: That was there?0x0ARon: Oh, you weren't paying attention.
8445	Tim: I was watching you guys, I was mesmerized.0x0ADave: One of the greatest things about this game was the shirt that we did with...
8446	...the three dimensional puffy spit0x0ARon: Oh and that monkeys down the sleeve?
8447	Tim: It's a great day for spitting. 0x0ADave: That was the Monkey 1 shirt.
8448	Ron: Was that the Monkey 1 shirt?0x0ATim: Monkey 1 was a tasteful shirt that you could wear outside. The Monkey 2 shirt...
8449	Ron: No that was...0x0ATim: ...you would just fold it up and put it away in a box  because it was so gross...
8450	...and there were gobs of spit all over it.0x0ARon: There were the puffy monkeys down the sleeve, was that Monkey 1?
8451	Dave: That was Monkey 1, yeah, the long sleeve one. 0x0ATim: Monkey 2 we did and we didn't get approval for it, and people at management...
8452	...were mad afterwards. They were like, that is the grossest shirt ever, I can't believe you made that.
8453	Tim: I love Wally the cartographer.
8454	Dave: Wally has just taken so much abuse over the course of this series, it just seems to me.
8455	Ron: Well you know, we cut that stuff at the end of the game with, you know, him on the raft and all that.
8456	Tim: That's right, we cut the whole raft thing.0x0ARon: I get a lot of email from people wanting to know what we were going to do..
8457	...with Wally and that whole cut section.0x0ATim: Could you show what happens to him now?
8458	Tim: Because when you blow up out of the, you know, the what you might call it, you blow up out of the, and then you used to land in a raft.
8459	Ron: Mm hmm.0x0ATim: I guess we'll find out.
8460	Ron: I don't remember.0x0ATim: That's a good voice for him. Woah, could you guys hear my ... internal organs?
8461	Ron: See now we steal his, err, we steal his monocle.0x0ATim: We steal his monocle, and it's super sad, yeah!...
8462	...we totally make him unable to do his job but because we needed the lens for our little...
8463	Ron:  Exactly.0x0ADave: Yup. Gonna ruin everyone in this town before we're done.
8464	Tim: Oh god I forgot about the graveyard! 0x0ARon: This is like the greatest scene ever.
8465	Tim: Why are the bats making different sounds here? 0x0ADave: Okay, so why...
8466	Tim: This is another thing we fought over. I thought the pants thing...I didn't think that was funny.
8467	Ron: I think the pants thing was hilarious.0x0ATim: And he thought it was the best thing in the whole game.
8468	Ron: I did. I did. And I still do. I still do. I actually use this as an example sometimes when I'm talking to people.
8469	Tim: You used to think it was funny and now realize it's not funny? 0x0ARon: No, it's like the pinnacle of humor. It's an un-top-able moment.
8470	Tim: But what, did he pull his belt off in order to dig... what, why did, why is...Why does that happen, Ron? Now, tell us!
8471	Ron: Because...0x0ADave: It's because the game requires different levels of humor. You've got your...
8472	...sophisticated, wry humor...0x0ATim: But why do his pants fall down? Did he take, did he use his belt to dig?
8473	Ron: You see, the problem is you're trying to justify it too much. It's just funny, just roll with it.
8474	Dave: It's fantasy. About pants falling down.0x0ARon: It's just a stupid computer game, Tim.
8475	Tim: See that's the, see, I think that could have been a really deep moment, his pants fell for a reason. For example he was digging up...
8476	Dave: Gravity?0x0ATim: Oh, you win. It's hilarious. But I never liked any of those... I was against the...
8477	...insult sword fighting, remember? I was, like, people are gonna be really mad.
8478	Ron: You were?0x0ATim: Well, for the beginning of the meeting, you were, like, how about, I think it's
8479	...action oriented if we actually put swordfighting in there, because it was going to be like, karataka, kartika, karateka. And umm, I think it's too...
8480	...too action-oriented, I think people would enjoy it more if it was just insults. Which I realized now is a great idea. At that time, I thought we were gonna get angry...
8481	...letters from people who want to use their sword. They, you know... But err, I saw the... I saw the light eventually.
8482	Ron: Well that came from those, all those time we spent watching those movies, in the media room at the main house, was the way the pirates, you know, verbally...
8483	...jousted with each other.0x0ATim: Mm hmm.
8484	Dave: Yeah I remember you saying, it was just what they said that it was important and that the sword fighting always seemed like a kind of background activity.
8485	Tim: Captain Dread! 0x0ADave: It's a great name!
8486	Ron: I never liked his name.0x0ATim: Captain Dread? That's a great name!
8487	Tim: It's both scary pirate name, and dreadlocks!0x0ARon: You're wrong.
8488	Tim: Maybe you don't realize this but those big chunks of 0x0Ahair are called dreadlocks.
8489	Ron: I think it was because the pun was too obvious. 0x0ATim: Oh, there is something too obvious and not subtle enough in Monkey Island...
8490	...for you, pants-dropper.0x0ARon: Right. Well it's because you're missing all the symbolism of the pants dropping.
8491	Tim: The thing I didn't like was that you never see his face except for the very beginning. His head is turned the whole time round.
8492	Tim: This is so disconcerting to see just the back of his head. He could just have his head, he could have his head just tilted a little bit like that.
8493	Tim: Oh that voodoo guy, I forgot about him. Oh geez. Oh, LeChuck's asymmetrical walking was the hardest thing to get right of any walk cycle, I think still to this...
8494	...day that was ever done. 0x0ARon: Because he couldn't be flipped?
8495	Tim: He couldn't be flipped, and he moved an uneven number of pixels every frame.0x0ADave: I like how much he spits when he talks too. More foreshadowing I guess.
8496	Tim: I forgot that voodoo character. What does he do, that voodoo guy?0x0ADave: I don't know, I can't remember.
8497	Ron: I actually don't remember him.0x0ATim: Dude I don't remember that guy at all! Does he? Let's cut him in the Special...
8498	...Edition, because he's...he's got a good voice though.0x0ADave: Yeah.
8499	Tim: Oh here comes this exciting sailing scene. Oh this was for the ship combat I worked so hard on!
8500	Ron: No, that was on Monkey 1. That was on Monkey 1.0x0ATim: It was not in Monkey 1.
8501	Dave: That's right.0x0ATim: It was in the cutting room floor of Monkey 1, cause it was too good for that...
8502	...game. Okay "Jolly Rasta" that's not a good name. "Dread" is a good name but "Jolly Rasta" isn't.
8503	Ron: Jolly Rasta is a bad name. 0x0ATim: It sounds like pasta.
8504	Ron: It's a horrible name. 0x0ADave: Should have been the "Jolly Pasta"?
8505	Tim: Yeah it should have been the "Jolly Pasta", should have been 0x0Athe "Elbow Macaroni."
8506	Dave: The thing I remember about Governor Phatt was just that, he was way bigger on screen than characters that we generally did.
8507	Tim: He was like a small planet. 0x0ADave: He didn't move around much, he was like yeah, just this enormous, guy.
8508	Ron: You could have lived inside him. 0x0ATim: We only animated his, like, mouth or something.
8509	Dave: Yeah. Which is kinda whole jiggle-y thing. 0x0ARon: One thing that I liked, I always liked about Monkey Island 1 and 2...
8510	...was how you're kinda playing this game and almost when you think the game's over, it's like then kinda the real game starts.
8511	So it's like you're spending all this time on Scabb Island or on Melee Island and you think you're kinda completing the main objective of the...
8512	...game and then the whole game kinda opens up after that. I always liked that.0x0ATim: And all of the err, RTS elements come in to it at that point.
8513	Dave: This game's huge! 0x0ARon: Yeah, and the first person shooter stuff, I don't know if people discovered that.
8514	Tim: I always loved this poster, I loved that, I always liked to do that I've always wanted to do that in other games...
8515	Like, every game should have a poster that lists everything you've done.0x0ARon: Oh, All the bad things?
8516	Tim: All the bad things you've done...0x0ARon: Stealing the monocle.
8517	Tim: In the voice of the character, in the voice of the, see we're obviously feeling bad about Guybrush's crimes, because we listed them here on this poster.
8518	Dave: We did that in, in Tales, in the 4th episode which is the Trial and Execution of Guybrush Threepwood.
8519	Tim: I've heard that's the...0x0ADave: You get...
8520	Tim: the best one ... 0x0ADave: Maybe the best one.
8521	Dave: Err, but the funniest bit is you get put on trial and it lists out all of the stuff you did in the 1st episodes.
8522	Dave: And that's all of the things you're under arrest for then.
8523	Ron: So this is also the big Pirates of the Caribbean ride rip-off moment, too.
8524	Dave: Yeah. Yeah we can't really complain about the movie ripping off the game...0x0ATim: Stealing this.
8525	Ron: They were just giving us back for this, that's all there really was. 0x0ATim: Yeah.
8526	Tim: And the dog's named Walt.0x0ADave: Is he?
8527	Dave: That Steve Purcell's dog?0x0ARon: Why was our dog named Walt?
8528	Tim: Is that not for Walt Disney? No. 0x0ADave: Steve Purcell's dog was called Walt. I think that was...
8529	Tim: Well that was probably named after Walt Disney. 0x0ADave: That is possible. Walt was a, I remember, kind of a mean old dog who...
8530	...bit me once. 0x0ATim: Dude, Walt's dead, don't make fun of Walt.
8531	Ron: I like that the dog was named after Walt Disney, let's just go with that. 0x0ATim: Yeah, it's a sweeter story.
8532	Ron: It's always really hard, you know, to design these 0x0Apuzzle things where he's confined in one room.
8533	Because it's like everything on him, and you have to figure out how to do it, and all of the solutions or...
8534	Tim: And if it's too hard, then it's just you're stuck in a tiny tiny room.0x0ARon: You're stuck, yeah. But if it's too easy, it's a gimme puzzle and it's just...
8535	...not interesting.0x0ADave: Just, there is something comforting about the fact that, you know, you...
8536	...can't go anywhere so you know all your assets are right there. There is some way out, like you, it's never like...
8537	Tim: Unless you were playing a Sierra game, then you could be a...0x0ADave:...game oh, I didn't pick something up three rooms away. I've gotta go get there.
8538	Tim: Pffft, Sierra...0x0ARon: Right, without the pencil.
8539	Tim: What's this room? I don't remember this room! Did they add this for the Special Edition?
8540	Dave: Is this the game where we put in the "If this is three, then what's this?" puzzle?
8541	Ron: Yes.0x0ADave: That was a mean, mean puzzle.
8542	Tim: I have an apology for that, that came from my family. 0x0ADave: Yeah?
8543	Tim: That was a trick, a game, my brother played with me. If this is two, what's this? If this is four, what's this?
8544	Ron: I remember that we went round and round trying to find some clever 0x0Athing to do that. I think that door existed for quite a while without any real...
8545	...puzzle there. 0x0ADave: There was like one of those "Insert Puzzle here" signs.
8546	Ron: Yeah, right. 0x0ADave: It's nice that we could actually do that on these games. Like, that's hard...
8547	...to do now, to design a game and say, "Well okay, here's a puzzle, we're just 0x0Agonna put something in later and we'll think of it, you know, two months from...
8548	...now while we're building the game we'll write some different dialogue for it." 0x0ARon: Dialogue recording, voice recording, really, I think, killed all that...
8549	...spontaneity that we had in Monkey 1 and Monkey 2.0x0ADave: You just have to be spontaneous earlier.
8550	Ron: Yeah. 0x0ADave: You don't have as much time to be spontaneous.
8551	Ron: It's on the calendar, spontaneity ends here. 0x0ADave: Right.
8552	Tim: I remember for a long time, the characters were the wrong scale in this room, and Guybrush was like, really tiny compared to this giant guy...
8553	...sitting at the end of the dock!0x0ADave: You're right... you've an amazing memory.
8554	Tim: I only remembered the bad things. It was that way for a long time till someone pointed out and was like "That guy is 3 times as big as Guybrush". Oh, ...
8555	...the library.0x0ADave: Didn't we have to make like a special big Guybrush to go in?
8556	Dave: In the room? 0x0ARon: Yeah 'cos we didn't have that kinda scaling. We could scale down, but...
8557	...we couldn't scale up.0x0ATim: But not up.
8558	Dave: Yeah, just turn into giant pixels anyway.0x0ARon: But we had all those extra floppy disks, so we could just. As much of...
8559	...that stuff as we wanted.
8560	Tim: Ok the library, is it true Dave, did you write all the books that are in here? All of the book titles?
8561	Dave: I didn't! I did do a lot of 'em but I remember we, I think we... we put out a call.
8562	Tim: To all of LucasArts?0x0ADave: To everybody like, err, hey! We need book titles and I think Captain...
8563	...Tripps actually wrote up a large number of them.0x0ATim: Oh really? Some of them I didn't realize were references to other things...
8564	...in the game until I read them on, like, Monkey Island fan pages, like there were all these little hidden clues.
8565	Dave: Yeah there's all kinds of references and stuff like that. References are fun!
8566	Tim: Yeah. What was the one? Something about the ending, something about LeChuck, and the fight that he had with Guybrush.
8567	Dave: There's a reference to that in the library?0x0ATim: Yeah, what does LeChuck say was the root of their fight? As children...
8568	...like some, some...  Embarassing that I don't know. 0x0ADave: Do you remember?.
8569	Ron: I don't remember...0x0ATim: The last scene when they were kids, and were like, we had this fight...
8570	...over something really trivial, and there's a reference to it in the library.0x0ARon: When you think they're kids, you mean.
8571	Tim: Oh, when the robots0x0ADave: Before the robots are programmed to think that they're kids.
8572	Ron: Right, right.0x0ATim: That's what I meant. And they don't realize that they're dead, and...
8573	...that one cute little boy who can see dead people.0x0ADave: Yeah, that part.
8574	Tim: Ok, look at those references.0x0ARon: Yeah let's actually...
8575	Tim: It's Sherlock Holmes! 0x0ARon: Lets go through all the library cards.
8576	Tim: Yeah, could we look...0x0ARon: Lets go through them all
8577	Dave: All of them? Aren't there like a hundred or...0x0ATim:  What's 1060 West Addison?
8578	Dave: That is the address of Wrigley Fields.0x0ARon: Wrigley Fields.
8579	Dave: From the Blues Brothers.0x0ATim: Oh my god... yeah.
8580	Dave: That is in fact an explicit reference to a joke in which someone gives a false address. So, perfectly appropriate.
8581	Tim: Stan... Look we took the costume from the original game and painted it black. Same animation.
8582	Ron: It's that cost savings we had to do.0x0ADave: The pattern that moves with the coat was like, something that we did on...
8583	...the 2D games to save ourselves a lot of effort, but as soon as they started making them in 3D then it became really hard.
8584	Ron: Right.0x0ATim: Wait how do we replicate that effect?
8585	Dave: I love any game that has a spitting contest. 0x0ATim: Look at that picture of the spit over there... the little banner with...
8586	...the spitting mouth.. ugh ... what a gross game. Who came up with the spitting contest?...
8587	...No one wants to own the spitting contest. No one's like "that's my baby. "0x0ARon: I think you programmed it though.
8588	Tim: No... Oh yeah I did, I did the programming of it. Cos it was really challenging.
8589	Dave: I liked the methods that were used to win; that was just cheat, cheat and cheat again basically.
8590	Ron: It's your standard Guybrush adventure game. 0x0ADave: Our games are forming the morals of the youth of today, the social...
8591	Tim: We're talking about pirates... can't teach positive moral values in a game about pirates. Pirates what do they do? They steal, they pillage...
8592	...and we're just lucky that they left out the third one.0x0ARon: You know, I did all those adventure games for kids at Humongous...
8593	...Entertainment, we really had to come up with very contrived reasons why you weren't just stealing everything that you had to pick up.
8594	Dave: I remember having to write a lot of lines for Pajama Sam about that0x0Aand my take was always, Oh I found this I'd better try and find the owner and...
8595	...give it back. And so, I'm carrying around all these things that were going to 0x0Ago back to somebody. Or if the person was there, he'd always ask to borrow it.
8596	... Can I borrow that?0x0ARon: Because adventure games just do not teach children good habits at all.
8597	Tim: But playing them can teach you valuable things like reading, English.0x0ARon: Stealing.
8598	Tim: Pointing, clicking,0x0ARon: Spitting.
8599	Dave: Spitting?0x0ATim: Saving often!
8600	Tim: Do you remember how we designed the puzzles for this on the whiteboard and we purposely did the thing that we later thought made it too hard but we...
8601	...put every island on the top and every puzzle chain on the side and then we made sure that there was an object on every island that you needed for every...
8602	...puzzle chain? So that if you wanted to solve any long puzzle chain you had to visit every single island so that's why if you actually play this game you had...
8603	...to go from island to island to island over and over and over again.0x0ARon: I remember in our discussions talking about, was that too annoying for...
8604	...players to constantly going from island to island to island to solve things?0x0ATim: And you said I don't care I said 40 hours. It's gonna be 40 hours.
8605	Ron: They've already bought it why do I care. 0x0ATim: I think the phrase you used was player be damned, right? That was one...
8606	... of the catch phrase 0x0ARon: That's kind of my design philosophy really.
8607	Tim: I worked on this part and there was a really funny bug where you make the chef mad at you and he chases you: around harassing you and I had a bug...
8608	...where I didn't get rid of the chef, and make him go back home if you'd left the area so he'd follow you around the map but the thing was we'd re-use...
8609	...actor numbers and he was like actor number 12 or something, and that actor was like Captain Dread's ship on the map so like, Captain Dread's ship would...
8610	...follow you around the map yelling "You're some scum and I don't like you0x94 every room you went into, a different random thing would just harass you and...
8611	...berate you.0x0ADave: Why didn't we leave that in?
8612	Ron: Oh this I love. this was one of my favorite... my favorite parts here.0x0ATim: Wait wait when does this happen?
8613	Dave: When he jumps off the ship and goes down.0x0ARon: There was big tech here.
8614	Tim: Oh yeah, 0x0ARon: Because we wanted it to seem like a long time.
8615	Tim: Oh, we did the scrolling...0x0ARon: With big scrolling...cause we didn't have vertical scrolling.
8616	Tim: And the camera angle change, there was a camera angle change, because you look up at the boat...
8617	Ron: It looks like it.. It's not a real camera angle change. 0x0ATim: Because there's no actual camera, because its 2D.
8618	Ron: This was all 3D, this was all 3D.0x0ADave: There was some color cycling in there, no?
8619	Ron: Yeah, we did color cycling for the water, and then we just moved...0x0ADave: Because there was no way to do a full screen effect with the technology of...
8620	...the day, we ran on 286.0x0ATim: We actually had a red version of that, oh wait that was colour cycling, when...
8621	...we turned the forest red for the bone dance. 0x0ARon: Must've been.
8622	Tim: I thought he was gonna kiss that monkey head. I remember Steve Purcell saying "What am I gonna do with 256 colors?" Like he went from Monkey 1 to...
8623	...2 and he's like "Too many colors! I cant take it!" For a long time all they did was add gradients; was like adding a gradient of colour in between everything.
8624	Dave: Steve has this amazing ability to take a block of 8 by 8 pixel block of 16 colours then make it look like anything.
8625	Tim: And that stuff is now these days cooler looking. Like you know how 8 bit art in general looks really hip and stylish now...
8626	Dave: That's right, there's a whole new revival movement. 0x0ATim: With that in between like VGA. I don't know that will ever look hip and cool...
8627	...in the same way that like EGA looked. Remember we had to go through the entire game and make it work in CGA?
8628	Dave: Yeah.0x0ATim: Because some people only used CGA that weird gross combination of pink...
8629	...and green.0x0ADave: There was like 2 blues 2 pinks or something.
8630	Ron: It's like a cyan and a weird magenta.0x0ATim: But the game would work on our Hercules monitors too though.
8631	Dave: That's right those monochrome monitors... that was our undocumented support.
8632	Ron: Yeah, we never shipped to work on the Hercules Monitors. But we always had those separate...
8633	Tim: It did though.0x0ARon: We always had those separate Hercules Monitors...those were our debug windows.
8634	Tim: And we had a separate mac for our email, we couldn't be bothered to read emails somehow and emails didn't work on PCs back then I guess.
8635	Ron: Why did we make this game so long? 0x0ATim: It's insecurity, I think obviously we were insecure, and we wanted to...
8636	...make it bigger, and we had like a size issue.0x0ARon: We had short game syndrome from the first one.
8637	Tim: No one ever complained about the first game, like nowadays, no matter what you do, people say your game is short. Back then, no one complained...
8638	...did they complain about Monkey being short?0x0ARon: No, no, they didn't.
8639	Dave: Just management. 0x0ARon: No, nobody complained about it.
8640	Tim: Complained about it being long...0x0ARon: I just think we over designed it, and then we also cut, we also cut a lot out of the game.
8641	Ron: I remember when you had that squirt bottle by your desk, and when people would come in and then they would talk to you for too long and...
8642	...you would squirt them like we were cats.0x0ATim: And eventually everyone turned on me and they tackled me and like...
8643	...Bret held me down underneath Tammy's desk and opened the lid on the squirt bottle and dumped it on my head.
8644	Ron: And then you went home pouting.0x0ATim: No, no I did not.
8645	Ron: Yes you did, you went home mad.0x0ATim: Well I was pretty mad. I was like, can't you take a joke.
8646	Dave: Can't YOU take a joke?
8647	Ron: See, this is another one of those puzzles where you're locked in one place.0x0ADave: Yeah I like those.
8648	0x0ATim: I loved that bit of dialogue, I don't even know who wrote it, but he makes the bones...
8649	...out of Guybrush's... He makes a chair out of his bones and he calls it a screaming chair because... I forget why, but it's awesome.
8650	Ron: I think that came from that thing about HR Giger, he made a chair0x0Aout of his dead girlfriend.
8651	Tim: Wait, no no no that was the guy...0x0ARon: Or maybe it's a myth that he did but I remember talking about that and I...
8652	...think that's why we did that.0x0ATim: I thought there was some other guy, wasn't it the guy who shot his wife...
8653	...with a bow and arrow and made chair and bones...? 0x0ADave: Who shot his wife with a bow and arrow?
8654	Ron: Robin Hood?0x0ATim: The guy from Naked Lunch.
8655	Dave: Oh Burroughs. Was that a bow and arrow? I knew he shot her...0x0ATim: He shot her with a gun and then he made a chair out of her bones...
8656	...That's pretty gruesome, he probably didn't do that0x0ADave: That's pretty gruesome...
8657	Tim: That's probably something I'm misremembered.0x0ADave: That's highly unlikely.
8658	Ron: This is fun how you had to line everything up and get the spit that we used earlier.
8659	Tim: Oh my god we have brilliant foreshadowing.0x0ADave: Amazing. Got all these nice green liquid to kind of motivate you to do that.
8660	Tim: I used to sit next to Tabby Tosti, Tabby Tosti who ran the hint lines right outside my office, and I would listen to her give hints all day long. and it...
8661	...was just, it was like "take this, take the map and go back here bla bla bla" She would just tell it. she wouldn't give hints like "well what do you think it is?"...
8662	...she would just lay it out. 0x0ADave: People were paying money, they just want the answer.
8663	Tim: Yeah, I guess so, but she would always answer the phone the same way "Lucasarts hint line CAN I HELP YOU?"
8664	Ron: My favorite was when they would call for hints, and they would get the hint to do what to do, and then they would say, "and then what happens?"
8665	Dave: And you'll find out...0x0ARon: Or try this...
8666	Tim: Do they still have hint lines?0x0ARon: Probably no...
8667	Dave: I think the internet destroyed it, but, for one brief glorious moment of history, that was like the biggest money maker for the entire company I think,..
8668	...was the hint line.
8669	Ron: This is where it all comes together and is explained fully. 0x0ATim: I think people might not understand this ending, because you have to...
8670	...know a lot about numerology, and science, and there is a lot of physics references...
8671	Ron: Food processing...0x0ATim: The Fibonacci sequence is incredibly important to this, all the clues.
8672	Dave: I remember we went back and forth alot, or round and round I guess a lot...
8673	...about the ending. You have it in your head and it was like, "I don't know,0x0Ashould we really do this, and we were trying to think of something different...
8674	...that was going to be better. I think I may have actually convinced you to do 0x0Athe ending that we did, at dinner one night. It was like no, no. We should...
8675	...just do it, it will be great, it will be kind of ambigious and seventies like...0x0ARon: I remember we went round and round and round...
8676	Tim: I kind of remembered it more as an iterative thing that we like, we did...0x0A...one part and we're like let's add one more twist to it, and then let's add...
8677	...another one again to make it like the first one didn't count, and let's add one more! It was hilarious.
8678	Ron: Well, I think this ending gets mentioned all the time on, you know, top ten0x0Abest endings of computer games, is the ending to Monkey Island 2.
8679	Tim: I think they complained about it.0x0ADave: It also ended up in the top 10 worst endings, it's like a very controversial...
8680	...ending. People love it or they hate it.0x0ARon: But, see, isn't that perfect though? I'd almost rather pick something half...
8681	...the people loved and half the people hated, than something a bunch of people felt mediocre about.
8682	Ron: Do you remember these rooms it was just one background that we turned on and off the doors?
8683	Tim: Generic room technology from Indy 4?0x0ARon: Yeah I think we had a patent on that.
8684	Tim: You can see it there when it flashes like that.0x0ARon: Yeah, see that's when it was weird when you cut from one to the other...
8685	...because certain things would not change and other things would change.0x0ATim: Cause originally, in Indy 4, where you go through the castle, and you go into...
8686	...a room then go into a hallway, then you go into another room then you don't see it.
8687	Ron: Right.0x0ATim: That was such a great game, is it Indy 3? Indy 3.
8688	Ron: Last Crusade.0x0ATim: Yeah, Last Crusade, that's when you go into the castle...
8689	Ron: The Last Crusade was when we first started doing the dialogue0x0Achoice things, and I think in Monkey 1 it was almost like the whole concept was...
8690	...proved out in a way and then I think we went nuts on Monkey Island 2 with the dialogues.
8691	Tim: When you hammer all the nails in Stan's coffin to trap him, I turned off Min Jiffies. There's a little SCUMM tip for you guys.
8692	Ron: To sort of go really fast?0x0ATim: Turn off Min Jiffies so it would go really fast. But I think on a modern...
8693	...computer it would go so fast that it would break the speed of light...0x0ARon: Go back in time?
8694	Tim: Yeah it might cause a shift. 0x0ARon: It would undo several puzzles that they had done previously.
8695	Tim: Remember turning off Min Jiffies it was like a Keystone Kops effect.0x0ARon: Well if you held down the shift key, you know in the debug mode, if you...
8696	...held down the shift key, it would just turn off Min Jiffies so we could run around as fast as we want, yeah.
8697	Tim: And so, when you can have the dialogue with Elaine, where you can either insult her, you had to grovel a bunch to win the puzzle they also get to have...
8698	...the choice to insult her, I remember watching and this one woman who was playing it, and she couldn't figure it out, and 'I was like 'Hey, have you...
8699	tried all the dialogues?' she's like 'Yeah, I've tried every dialogue option." 0x0AI was like "What about that one there? There is a dialogue option about "Have...
8700	...you gained weight?" And she was like, 'I'd never say THAT to her!'0x0ARon: That's too far, that was the line.
8701	Tim: Yeah, she was like, even to an imaginary video game character, I would never say "Have you gained weight"
8702	Ron: These pants make me look fat.
8703	Tim: How do you solve this puzzle? You blow the horn and that makes the canoneer fire his cannon? Why does he do that?
8704	Ron: It's an adventure game, who knows? 0x0ATim: And then you have to watch that girl's belt to see if the wind is blowing.
8705	Ron: To see if the wind... right... 0x0ATim: Oh and you have to move the flags.
8706	Dave: You have to move the flags that's why you keep distracting people with the cannon, yeah? Yeah.
8707	Tim: I like that new, save icon they have.0x0ADave: Oh so one of the things that you do is not cheating!
8708	Tim: You distract a guy so you can move the flags, oh and then you're using wind. Which is also another thing a pirate has to do. As a sailor, understand
8709	the wind. Understand the direction of the wind. 0x0ADave: You'll notice though with the green stuff that you make and drink...
8710	...we sort of predicted the entire like all the other doping scandals in all the other sports.
8711	Tim: Do you have to make special spit? 0x0ARon: Was he juiced? Is Guybrush juiced in this?
8712	Dave: He's juiced, yeah. 0x0ATim: Oh juiced... I thought you...
8713	Dave: The recipe of the green gunk that makes your spit hang together better.0x0ATim: Why would that make your spit fly farther.
8714	Dave: It makes it hang together better. 0x0ATim: Wouldn't that make it also heavier?
8715	Dave: Well, I'm not sure the weight of a glob of spit is the limiting factor there.You can spit it harder and...trust me, the last time I was in a spitting contest....
