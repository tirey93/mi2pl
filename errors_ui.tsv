161	This is a term of distinction for pirates! It is reserved for those pirates who are both wealthy and honorable.
162	The “Jolly Roger0x94 refers to the skull and crossbones found on the pirate flag! Anyone given this title is a true pirate.
163	A “scallywag0x94 is a bad person. A scoundrel. Considered to be clever and dangerous.
164	The term “Picaroon0x94, is from the Spanish word for rascal. It is meant to describe pirates in a way that is satirical or humorous.
165	The “Helmsman0x94 is the Captain's attendant, who is tasked with rowing him to and from the ship.
166	“Grog0x94 is a pirate's favorite drink. Although the type of alcohol used to make it may vary, more often than not it contains large quantities of rum.
167	"Lubber" was an old English word for a big, slow, clumsy person, and this term was aimed at those persons on ship who were not very skilled or at ease with ship life, as if to say, "You were no better on the land."
168	A “squiffy0x94 is a buffoon. A “sprog0x94 is an untrained recruit. When someone calls you this, you should expect to be walking the plank very soon.
